<div class='content'>I understand you&#39;re posting hashes of interesting blog-posts that you can&#39;t yet reveal, but you&#39;ve been doing it for some time now. When one day you can reveal a thing, will you link back to the original post? Or are you relying on some eternally-hopeful soul to hash every post you make and compare it against this hypothetical archive of Interesting Hashes?<br></div>
