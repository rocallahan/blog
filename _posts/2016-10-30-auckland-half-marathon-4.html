<p><a href="https://secure.tiktok.biz/results/view/aucklandmarathon/2016/11139">Official time 1:46:34, net time 1:45:14</a>. This is my new personal best; I've been getting faster every year. This year I did a bit more training than <a href="http://robert.ocallahan.org/2015/11/sunday-was-extraordinary.html">last year</a>, but I'm a bit disappointed because I didn't push myself as hard as last year.
<p>At this pace and distance my feet aren't quite tough enough; both this year and last year a spot of skin on my right foot wore through and started bleeding. I don't feel it while I'm running but it's not a good look, so either I need to do more training or wear my Vibrams if I'm going to run faster or further.

<div class='content'>You may try climbing tapes on the weak point of your soles. I do that when I need to run fast in barefoot.</div>

<div class='content'>Congrats! Are you racing in different shoes than in training? That could explain the bleeding.</div>

<div class='content'>No, I&#39;m running barefoot both racing and training. That explains the bleeding :-)</div>

<div class='content'>I&#39;ve done solo runs up to 30km before without this bleeding issue. It only happens when I&#39;m trying to run fast.</div>
