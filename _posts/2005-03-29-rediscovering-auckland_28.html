<div class="columns">Over the last month or so our lives have started to settle down and we've had time --- and great weather --- to get out, visit friends and relatives, and see Auckland again after ten years away.<br/><br/>Strangely, I feel a much stronger desire to really <em>know</em> this city than I did before. For example, there are <a href="http://www.gns.cri.nz/what/earthact/volcanoes/arc/index.html">dozens of volcanic cones</a> in the city, most of which have been turned into parks, but I've only been to a handful of them. So yesterday we went to Mount St John for the first time.</div><br/><br/><div class="image"><img alt="Crater of Mount St John" src="/assets/images/images/MtStJohnCrater.jpg" width="800" height="600"></div><br/><br/><div class="columns">It's quite thrilling to walk through this upper-class suburb in the middle of everything, walk up a strip of reserve between houses and pop out above an amazing natural amphitheatre with amazing views over the city. I wonder how I managed to pass close by hundreds of times --- my old high school is perhaps a mile away --- being only barely aware it was there. Perhaps it's because Mount St John has larger and more famous neighbours --- Mount Hobson, Mount Eden and One Tree Hill.<br/><br/>Here's another shot of the view from the top. Auckland aficionados may wish to identify the four volcanic cones visible in this picture.</div><br/><br/><div class="image"><img alt="View from Mt St John" src="/assets/images/images/AKVolcanoes.jpg" width="800" height="600"/></div><br/><br/><div class="columns">This Easter long weekend we also went to the Royal Easter Show, walked around One Tree Hill and Albert Park, and had lunch with friends at Grand Harbour and T-Mark. T-Mark is a rather obscure Taiwanese cafe in Newmarket --- very good. I'm exhausted and looking forward to a relaxing day at work tomorrow!</div><br/><br/>

<div class='content'>Rangitoto, Northhead, Mt. St. John is the trick missing fourth one obviously, and then...? I wish I could place St. John in my memory so I could pinpoint where the last one would be. Is it Wellington? Hmm, no, it looks too close to the coast for that... Oh well, I&#39;m just a stupid tourist anyway, so I guess it&#39;s okay that I don&#39;t know. :P<br>Urgh on it looking like the drought has been keeping up, btw. That grass should be _way_ greener (and was, just a month ago, even though I thought it was awfully brown even then).<br></div>

<div class='content'>Thank you Robert!<br>I love your stories and pictures about NZ/Auckland. I did a student exchange to NZ a few years ago and it&#39;s allways great to remember the good times I had there.<br></div>
