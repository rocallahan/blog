<div class="columns"><p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bernardhenri-levy/with-the-all-blacks-in-du_b_787391.html?ir=World">This</a> is very weird. French philosopher Bernard-Henri Lévy writes about the recent rugby match between Ireland and the All Blacks ... in exactly the style you'd expect from a French philosopher. It's cool yet slightly annoying ... again, as you'd expect from a French philosopher!</div><br/><br/>

<div class='content'>BHL is not a philosopher, although he claims to be one.<br>This is easy to demonstrate. A common (admittedly flawed yet helpful nonetheless) way to measure the influence of a given scholar is to find out how often he or she is cited by his peers. BHL appears in the popular media, and particularly on television, all the [expletive] time. He is cited in scholarly literature about ... never.<br>Therefore his peers are not philosophers, they are TV pundits.<br>I won&#39;t go into the details of his political orientation (neocon with occasional leftist populist outbursts would be a good summary), but to give you an idea of the intellectual magnitude of the man, consider this: one of his latest tomes presented as facts quotes from a satirical essay. He evidently did not realize it was tongue in cheek. Before you venture to credit him with a shred of benefit of the doubt, said satire was titled &quot;Landru, precursor of feminism?&quot;<br>Landru (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_D%C3%A9sir%C3%A9_Landru) was a famous early XXth century serial killer of women.<br></div>

<div class='content'>Actually, BHL is all but a philosopher :)<br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard-Henri_Lévy#Criticisms<br>And his texts written in French are even more painful to read...<br></div>
