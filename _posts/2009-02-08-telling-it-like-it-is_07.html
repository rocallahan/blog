<div class="columns"><p>I watched a little bit of cricket yesterday, <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&objectid=10555534">NZ vs Australia in Melbourne</a>. Australia's usually dominant, but currently in a bit of a slump, and some NZ fans had a banner, "EVEN WE'RE BETTER THAN YOU". I think that says a lot about NZers --- both good and bad.</div><br/><br/>
