<div class="columns">About this time last year, I did some work to improve <tt>ld</tt> performance and reported it on this blog, getting to the point where I could link <tt>gklayout.so</tt> with debug symbols in only five seconds. Sadly at some point during my SUSE upgrades, things went downhill again: recently it's been taking about 70 seconds to link. Vlad says he's seen similar performance regressions with the <tt>ld</tt> in Fedora Core 5.<br/><br/>So I went to investigate, and the first thing I found is that the <tt>ld</tt> in binutils CVS HEAD only takes 10 seconds, i.e., it's seven times faster that the SUSE package. So my advice to other Linux developers is, if you feel that the packaged <tt>ld</tt> is sluggish, try building your own from CVS.</div><br/><br/>
