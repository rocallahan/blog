<p>I'm visiting the Bay Area in the coming week to talk about <a href="http://rr-project.org">rr</a> and where it could go. It's a mix of organised talks and smaller meetings. The talks are as follows:
<ul>
<li>Monday October 3, 2:30pm: Dropbox (SF office, 333 Brannan St)
<li>Tuesday October 4, 11:00am: Google (MTV-PLY-2)
<li>Thursday, October 6, 10:00am: Intel (Santa Clara, 3600 Juliette Lane)
<li>Friday, October 7, 3:30pm: Berkeley (511 Soda Hall)
</ul>
<p>I haven't scheduled anything at Mozilla this time. They've already heard me talk about rr a lot :-).
<p>Thanks to all the people who helped me organise this. I still have some free time in my schedule for additional meetings as necessary.
