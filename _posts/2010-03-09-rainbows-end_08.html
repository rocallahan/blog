<div class="columns"><p>I just finished reading Vernor Vinge's <em>Rainbows End</em>. Pretty good, but I think <em>A Fire Upon The Deep</em> and <em>A Deepness In The Sky</em> were better. I think in <em>Rainbows End</em> the technology gets a bit in the way of the story ... Vinge carefully prognosticates and extrapolates, and that makes it overwrought.<br/><p>Having said that, the prognostication is quite good and worth reading and thinking about. And having said THAT, there are a few major blind spots. In Vinge's world, software usually works, porn and spam are almost absent, and nations with extraordinary totalitarian power don't abuse it. Hmm ... I doubt it :-).</div><br/><br/>

<div class='content'>Hmm. I agree that Rainbows End doesn&#39;t top A Deepness in the Sky (my favorite). However, I think it&#39;s evident that he wanted to avoid the obvious plot lines you get in a total-surveillance society. After all, he&#39;s already (brilliantly) covered a lot of those in A Deepness in the Sky.<br>The authorities certainly do use the system in ways that should seem abusive. We see it in the way they track the spread of a minor disease at the beginning of the book, in the information Bob has at his disposal when he&#39;s on watch, etc. The really surprising thing was the amount of firepower Bob had at his disposal, given that he wasn&#39;t watching over a war zone. That&#39;s even extended into the electronic realm when they revoke Credit Suisse&#39;s certificates, destroying a huge swath of economic activity that had been mediated by the net. All without due process!<br>Also, how badly did Rainbows End make you want to read something by &quot;Jerzy Hacek&quot;?<br></div>

<div class='content'>The Wikipedia page for the book contains this quote in the lead:<br>&quot;Your hack was noticed. Back when I was young, you could have got a patent off it.

<div class='content'>Long ago, I quite enjoyed A Fire Upon the Deep.  I liked how the zone concept hinted at the sheer locality of some of humankind&#39;s most amazing discovered truths (and conveniently gets around nature&#39;s speed limit at the same time).  I&#39;ll have to add Deepness and Rainbows to my to-read list; thanks for the post.<br></div>
