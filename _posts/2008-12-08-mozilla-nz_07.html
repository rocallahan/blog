<div class="columns"><p>The last couple of weeks were quite exciting in the Mozilla Auckland office: interns Michael Ventnor and Brian Birtles started, and new hire Jonathan Kew was visiting. Michael has been working on bugs related to text-shadow and box-shadow, and is looking for more GTK integration projects. Brian will be working on SMIL. Jonathan is working on text and fonts; his current project is implementing Core Text integration for Mac while fixing some blocker bugs on the side. Everyone else is busy with their usual stuff; Karl just landed downloadable fonts support for GTK/Pango on trunk.<br/><p>On Friday we went out for a Christmas-y dinner bash at Al Dente.</div><br/><div class="image"><img alt="Mozilla NZ dinner" title="Mozilla NZ dinner" src="/assets/images/MozillaNZ2008.jpg" width="800" height="600"/></div><br/><br/>

<div class='content'>First, it&#39;s not a problem if they don&#39;t want to do it. And they don&#39;t, mostly.<br>Second, you&#39;re wrong. Variety is the spice of life, but nobody believes that all recipes should be 50% salt: you add a LITTLE for flavor. It&#39;s possible to have too much of a good thing. Massive diversity is not a strength, it&#39;s a headache. Human nature is what it is and no amount of wishful thinking and fantasizing will change it.<br>Freedom is the answer. Let women do what they want, but if they don&#39;t want to be computer scientists and programmers, then so what. And if employers don&#39;t want to hire them, then so what -- according to you, they&#39;re only hurting themselves and should be out of business in short order relative to an &quot;enlightened&quot; employer.<br></div>

<div class='content'>While it&#39;s true there are two women in the photo (and one more taking the photo), it&#39;s also true that there are no female developers in the Mozilla NZ office.<br>That&#39;s because women who do our sort of work are rare. They do exist --- I know a few --- but the ones I know are in the USA and busy being professors or cashed-up Google zillionaires or are otherwise happy where they are. I would hire a qualified female applicant in a heartbeat if one appeared; none has.<br>The reasons for this unfortunate situation are complex and controversial and not well understood by me, so I won&#39;t try to explain. You can read a lot of research on this subject. It&#39;s definitely not just a Mozilla problem or a NZ problem, it&#39;s a world-wide, industry-wide problem.<br></div>

<div class='content'>Of course its a problem...<br>Its worthwhile to have a different kind of view in every workspace(a woman&#39;s brain work differently from a manÂ´s) so its problem that there&#39;s so few woman working in our field.<br>Plus its more fun to hang out in a diversified ambient &amp;etc&amp;etc<br></div>
