<p>This weekend was Queen's Birthday Weekend so we got Monday off. The weather was excellent the whole weekend. On Saturday my family went to Mangawhai Heads (about 1.5 hours drive from Auckland) and did the Mangawhai Cliffs Track. We walked up the beach, around the rocks to the headland, then up the hill on the track, through the bush and along the clifftops back to the beach and carpark. It was dazzlingly beautiful and a good reminder that although people here like to complain about the weather, having such brilliant and warm days in winter is one of the great blessings of the Auckland region.
