<div class="columns"><p>This Thursday night (June 23) we'll be giving a talk at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/aucklandweb/events/18077721/">Auckland Web Meetup</a>.<br/><blockquote>Web standards and browser implementations are rapidly evolving features that enable sophisticated games to be written as standards-based Web apps. These features include fast JS engines, GPU-accelerated 2D and 3D graphics (canvas and WebGL), video/audio, WebSockets, and emerging proposed standards for advanced audio effects, fullscreen APIs, and peer-to-peer real-time communication. We'll show some demos and benchmarks, explain about the technology behind them, describe the browser support landscape, and discuss what happens next. We want feedback from developers to help guide our priorities and technical decisions.</blockquote><br/><p>Indeed, as usual I'll be going to as much to get feedback from Web developers as to spread our own message.</div><br/><br/>
