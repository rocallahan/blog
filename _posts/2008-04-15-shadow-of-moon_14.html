<div class="columns"><p>I sneaked off work today with my wife and we watched <a href="http://www.intheshadowofthemoon.com/"><em>In The Shadow Of The Moon</em></a>, being screened as part of a local film festival. It was brilliant! Amazing footage, very well put together, and the astronaut interviews are really good --- moving, funny, and insightful. I'm not a big fan of manned spaceflight but you can certainly see the appeal. Recommended.</div><br/><br/>

<div class='content'>Why are you not a big fan of manned space flight?<br>I&#39;m not either.  I think it&#39;s a massive waste of time and resources.  Send out probes I say.  :-)<br></div>

<div class='content'>Never send a human to do a robot&#39;s job!<br>Manned spaceflight sort of made sense in the 60s, when robotics technology was a lot more primitive. But now manned missions are basically joyrides; as you say, they&#39;re massively wasteful compared to robotic missions for the same goals.<br>Actually I&#39;m still in favour of human space travel, but it should be one-way missions delivering colonists to self-sustaining habitats constructed by earlier waves of robots.<br></div>
