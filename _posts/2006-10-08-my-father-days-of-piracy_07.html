<div class="columns">The New Zealand Herald has <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/search/story.cfm?storyid=0003D3AF-EFBA-1525-9BD383027AF100AD">story about my father, Denis O'Callahan</a>. It's nearly the fortieth anniversary of the first transmission of Radio Hauraki, New Zealand's first and only pirate radio station, created by my father and a few other like-minded guys in their twenties. At the time the New Zealand Government didn't allow private radio stations, so the idea was to set up a transmitter on a ship in international waters to work around the law. It was a crazy, risky undertaking, full of nautical, engineering, legal and financial challenges, and it succeeded. (After a few years the government caved to popular demand and granted them a land license.) My dad was both the original radio engineer and boat skipper, and of course I'm immensely proud of him.</div><br/><br/>
