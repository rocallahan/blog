<p>Many people in New Zealand feel down when the All Blacks lose, especially in the World Cup. It seems silly to me, although I'm sometimes one of them; sports simply aren't that important. Along with that we have an unhealthy tendency to excoriate and repudiate losing teams, which apart from being unfair is also irrational because in most close games, factors outside the team's control could easily have determined the result.<br />
<p>Therefore, I have a plan. Starting tomorrow night (when I will be watching NZ vs Australia at Eden Park) I intend to enjoy watching the game whether the All Blacks win or lose, and encourage others to do the same. We'll see if I make it through the World Cup :-).
