<p>In the two years since <a href="https://robert.ocallahan.org/2016/03/leaving-mozilla.html">I left Mozilla</a> I've been working  on a new debugger (with Kyle Huey, most of that time). We call it Pernosco &mdash; "know thoroughly". Pernosco takes rr recordings of failing runs, analyzes them in the cloud, and provides a Web interface for developers to debug them. It uses components of rr but the debugger implementation is completely different. Pernosco's data-oriented approach has features and performance that rr's approach cannot match &mdash; and nor can any other debugger. We've reached the point where external users have used Pernosco to fix real bugs, and their response has been very enthusiastic. It's exciting!
<p>Developers spend a lot of time figuring out bugs. We think Pernosco will create a lot of value for software development organizations. We intend to capture some of that value by offering Pernosco as a paid cloud service. We have many ideas for making debugging easier and more fun, and we need a sustainable business model to make them happen. It's especially important because debugging is an area that has been chronically under-invested in across the industry.

Any ideas on timeframes and possible prices?</div>

<div class='content'>Like I said, people are already using it. People you know :-).

Ideally the cost would be based on estimating how much money we&#39;re saving the customer and taking a percentage of that.</div>

<div class='content'>Hey, I know you too. ;-)

You could start with covering the server costs, and then once everybody is addicted, go for the corporate jugular!</div>
