<div class="columns"><p>Based on the All Blacks' games so far:<br/><ol><br/><li>All Blacks lose to France in the quarter-final; a high error rate snuffs out promising attacks and France score intercept tries.<br/><li>The international press, who have been praising the All Blacks to the skies, explain how over-rated they always were.<br/><li>The rest of the rugby world learns that the way to ensure the ABs do not win the World Cup is to never, ever play your A team against them except in the knockout stages of the WC.<br/><li>The press gloats about how the ABs never win the WC, which is the only contest that matters. At the same time, the press complains that no-one takes non-WC games seriously anymore.<br/><li>The press complains that conservative, keep-it-tight rugby is boring. At the same time, the press ridicules the ABs for playing a wide game, which everyone knows is not the way to win the World Cup (the only contest that matters, see above).<br/></ol><br/></div><br/><br/>

<div class='content'>I don&#39;t agree with you. I think that the only way France can win against the All Blacks is to play an extremely non-boring game.<br>They can&#39;t afford not to have solid bases, of course, but &quot;keep-it-tight&quot; &quot;down-to-earth&quot; &quot;aim-low-reach-low&quot; rugby is only sufficient to win against Ireland or England (although Wilkinson tends to make his team play wider and more supercool).<br>Any of Springboxes, Wallabies or All Blacks is far more difficult a team to chew.<br></div>

<div class='content'>But of course we have a player that sends chills down the spinal column of opposite players, and makes our supporters go &quot;whoouuahh&quot; anytime he touches the ball (even if he doesn&#39;t do anything fancy), so we should win (except if the AB recall Jonah Lomu ;)<br>[I personally think Chabal is only part of the team, a good player, but Michalak or Ellisalde impress me far more]<br></div>

<div class='content'>Even the NZ crowd gave Chabal a standing ovation when he left the field this year. And that was after he&#39;d broken the jaw of one of our best players!<br></div>
