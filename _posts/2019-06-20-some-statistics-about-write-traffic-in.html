<p>For people who like <a href="/2016/05/data-on-x86-64-register-usage.html">this</a> <a href="/2016/05/x86-64-sseavx-register-usage.html">sort</a> of <a href="/2016/06/some-dynamic-measurements-of-firefox-on.html">thing</a>...
<p>I became interested in how much CPU memory write traffic corresponds to "stack writes". For x86-64 this roughly corresponds to writes that use RSP or RBP as a base register (including implicitly via <tt>PUSH</tt>/<tt>CALL</tt>). I thought I had pretty good intuitions about x86 machine code, but the results surprised me.
<p>In a Firefox debug build running a (non-media) DOM test (including browser startup/rendering/shutdown), Linux x86-64, <em>non-optimized</em> (in an rr recording, though that shouldn't matter):
<table style="line-height:1">
<thead><td>Base register<td>Fraction of written bytes</thead>

<tr><td>RAX<td>0.40%
<tr><td>RCX<td>0.32%
<tr><td>RDX<td>0.31%

<p>Ooof! I expected stack writes to dominate, since non-opt Firefox builds have lots of trivial function calls and local variables live on the stack, but 97.6% is a lot more dominant than I expected.
<p>You would expect optimized builds to be much less stack-dominated because trivial functions have been inlined and local variables should mostly be in registers. So here's a Firefox <em>optimized</em> build:
<table style="line-height:1">
<thead><td>Base register<td>Fraction of written bytes</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>RAX<td>1.23%
<tr><td>RCX<td>0.78%
<tr><td>RDX<td>0.36%
<tr><td>RBX<td>2.75%
<tr><td>RSP<td>75.30%
<tr><td>RBP<td>8.34%
<tr><td>RSI<td>0.98%
<tr><td>RDI<td>4.07%
<tr><td>R8<td>0.19%
<tr><td>R9<td>0.06%
<tr><td>R10<td>0.04%
<tr><td>R11<td>0.03%
<tr><td>R12<td>0.40%
<tr><td>R13<td>0.30%
<tr><td>R14<td>1.13%
<tr><td>R15<td>0.36%
<tr><td>RIP<td>0.14%
<tr><td>RDI (MOVS/STOS)<td>3.51%
<tr><td>Other<td>0.03%
<tr style="font-weight: bold"><td>RSP/RBP<td>83.64%
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Definitely less stack-dominated than for non-opt builds &mdash; but still very stack-dominated! And of course this is not counting <em>indirect</em> writes to the stack, e.g. to out-parameters via pointers held in general-purpose registers. (Note that opt builds could use RBP for non-stack purposes, but Firefox builds with <tt>-fno-omit-frame-pointer</tt> so only in leaf functions, and even then, probably not.)
<p>It would be interesting to compare the absolute number of written bytes between opt and non-opt builds but I don't have traces running the same test immediately at hand. Non-opt builds certainly do a lot more writes.
