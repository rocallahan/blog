<div class="columns"><p>There are a lot of people around the world perpetrating evil through their stupidity, selfishness, thoughtlessness and malice. But only rarely do we see someone almost single-handedly ruin an entire country without even ignorance as an excuse. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/07/world/africa/07zimbabwe.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all&oref=slogin">Robert Mugabe</a>'s doing it. As I recall, Zimbabwe was once doing quite well by African standards, with functioning institutions and a decent economy. Now it's spiraling down into a hellhole quite efficiently thanks to Mr Mugabe ... who blames everything on a mysterious Western plot. It enrages me every time I think about it.<br/><p>What's even more disturbing, in some ways, is that the South African government continues to befriend him, apparently due to old revolutionary loyalties. This doesn't bode well for South Africa itself.</div><br/><br/>
