<p>Recently I removed Google+ from my Google account. Unfortunately, people are still adding my account to their Google+ circles. (I had assumed they wouldn't be able to do that anymore.) Worse, I now get an email every time they do that. The email has tiny text saying "To change what emails Google+ sends to you, you can always manage email subscriptions on the settings page." with a link. When I click on the link, guess what happens? It goes straight to a "Join Google+" page with no way to turn off the emails (unless I rejoin Google+ I guess) :-(. It's odious.
<p>I'm still getting emails from Linkedin too. These sites are like malaria, once you've had them they're incurable.

<div class='content'>Who +1s this page?
And why would anybody join any service with his/her main email address?
This way you can&#39;t control what gets sent there, agreed.</div>

<div class='content'>It is not just once you have had them. I joined Google+ because it was sending me email about people adding me to their circles <em>before</em> I signed up. Thanks, my “friends”! Telling Google things about me on my behalf that I never intended to tell it myself is a great service. So I joined, for the sole reason of putting some text on my profile to please <strong>not</strong> add me. This has proven ineffective: people still do. So I now assume (because I never used G+ enough to find out) that the continuing trickle of circle-adds is based on some kind of scummy “upload your address book” feature.

It makes me mad.

Do I have to start passing out single-use email addresses to <em>everyone</em> now?</div>

<div class='content'>I&#39;ve had no problem turning G+ on and off, I honestly can&#39;t see how you could possibly be experiencing this.</div>

<div class='content'>I have the same problem but from the opposite angle.
I have Google Plus and it gave me a list of people I might want to add so I did.
What it didn&#39;t tell me was that these people were NOT on Google Plus AND that it would email them on my behalf to ask to sign up.
So now I am the spammer!
The reason it doesn&#39;t work to write on your profile is that it doesn&#39;t display your profile when it suggests &quot;People you might know&quot;.

This is Bullshit.</div>

<div class='content'>I&#39;ve never joined google plus, but my gmail account is continually spammed with top topics, etc, regularly from google plus.  clicking on the remove link demands that I join google plus before I can do anything about it!</div>

<div class='content'>Anytime a &#39;service&#39; is forced upon me it automatically makes me despise it. Good job on the aggressive approach google. I&#39;ll never touch the service now just for that reason alone.</div>
