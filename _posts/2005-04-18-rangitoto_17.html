<div class="columns">Last weekend our family went to Rangitoto Island on Saturday morning. It's a wonderful trip; the ferry ride to and from the island is great, the climb to the top is easy, the summit views magnificent, and the 600-year-old volcanic island itself is a unique and fascinating environment. Being mostly black lava, it does get hot on a sunny afternoon so I recommend doing as we did, taking the 9:15am ferry from downtown and the 12:45pm return ferry.<br/><br/>The summit outlook over Auckland and the islands of the Hauraki Gulf are incredible, and my photos can't do it justice. I offer you one photo from the track, looking back to Auckland City.</div><br/><br/><div class="image"><img alt="rangi-track.jpg" src="/assets/images/images/rangi-track.jpg" width="974" height="577" /></div><br/><br/>
