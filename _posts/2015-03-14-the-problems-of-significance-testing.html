<p><a href="http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/1/3/140216">This article</a> is an excellent, easy to read, easy to understand explanation of why the significance testing approaches used in many scientific disciplines are bogus. Almost everything he says applies just as well to computer science as to the author's field (medicine). I'm pleased to see the author call out the catastrophic bias of the publishing system against negative results --- something I've been ranting about for decades.
