<div class="columns">Today our family went to Duder Regional Park near Auckland. It's a lovely spot, a farm on a peninsula near the islands of the southern Hauraki Gulf. It's winter now, so it was cool (about 10-15C) and a little wet, but still a great walk to the tip of the peninsula ... and we only saw about six other people the four hours we were there. The drive out there is also beautiful, passing through rural areas and right next to the water's edge around Maraetai. It also passes through Auckland's eastern suburbs, which have a high concentration of Asian immigrants and hence there are great places to eat on the way there or back.</div><br/><br/><div class="image"><img alt="Rainbow" src="/assets/images/images/DuderRainbow.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></div><br/><br/>
