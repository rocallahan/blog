<div class="columns"><p>On Wednesday I'm taking off to the US for about 10 days. First I plan to visit Boston to see a few friends and give a <a href="http://www.csail.mit.edu/events/eventcalendar/calendar.php?show=event&id=2019">talk at MIT about Chronicle</a> on Thursday. Then I'm heading to New York on Friday where I'll give a talk at IBM Research about Web stuff (3pm, 1S-F40). On Saturday I'm at a friend's wedding. On Saturday night I fly back to California for a platform work week. Hopefully that week I'll also be able to attend the <a href="http://blog.whatwg.org/october-2008-meetups">WHATWG social event</a> in Mountain View.<br/><p>It's going to be somewhat tiring and I probably won't be very responsive online until I get to California, but I should be quite responsive from then on --- especially if you manage to corner me in meatspace!</div><br/><br/>
