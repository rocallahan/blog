<p>Rust 1.23 just came out and the release notes failed to mention what is, for me, by far its best new feature: <tt>cargo build --all-targets</tt> and <tt>cargo check --all-targets</tt> work properly. For the first time, we have a single command that really builds all targets &mdash; examples, tests, etc &mdash; in a single pass. Likewise we finally have a single command that checks all that code. This has improved our build times and made <tt>cargo check</tt> much more useful. I'm surprised there isn't more fuss about it.
