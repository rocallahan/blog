<p>Microsoft released an <a href="http://www.cuttherope.ie">HTML5 version of Cut The Rope</a> which is pretty cool. Unfortunately they use Flash audio by default for Firefox users because, <a href="http://www.cuttherope.ie/dev/">they say</a>, "some Firefox users could have run into an audio problem but will notice we fall back to a flash plugin to ensure that sound effects and music will work." They don't mention specific Firefox bugs (although they do for Chrome), and when I try the <a href="http://www.cuttherope.ie/?html5audio=true">HTML5 audio</a> version it works fine for me. So, please try the HTML5 version in Firefox (release or nightly), and if it doesn't work let me know and file bugs! Thanks!

<div class='content'>The game doesn&#39;t work if you don&#39;t have Adobe Flash Player installed. Disable Flash Player through Add-ons Manager and try yourself, even if you forced HTML5 Audio it will be stuck at 00% and simply won&#39;t load.

Gecko/20120110 Firefox/12.0a1

Retarded developers should get off the web.</div>

<div class='content'>Ah it works super for me with the HTML5 audio version. Firefox 10 beta here.
It wouldn&#39;t load first, but that was probably because I had FlashBlock installed.</div>

<div class='content'>Like the previous commenters, it hangs on load for me if I disable Flash (with html5audio=true of course). It&#39;s doing something weird with Flash as the plugin keeps using CPU, but once it&#39;s loaded you can kill it and the sound keeps playing, so I guess it&#39;s working as it should.

With that out of the way, I don&#39;t notice any sound problems.

That said and while we&#39;re at it, a drive-by complaint: volume changes take a long while (a buffer length&#39;s worth, ~2 seconds?) to propagate. It doesn&#39;t affect this game but is annoying enough for video playback, and could be a big issue for games that use dynamic attenuation.</div>

<div class='content'>Check this out for an explaination http://nerdplusart.com/why-is-there-flash-in-the-html5-version-of-cut-the-rope

If a user comes to the site in an HTML5 browser that doesn’t support .mp3 (mostly Firefox which only supports .ogg) then the library will force Flash audio. So, in Firefox we inadvertently ended up with a hard dependency on Flash. This, understandably, was frustrating to Firefox users. The good news is that we’ve fixed that check and will deploy a build with the fix in (hopefully) the next 48 hours.


If you’re curious about the audio bugs, you can force the game to use HTML5 audio (no flash) with this link: http://www.cuttherope.ie/?html5audio=true</div>

<div class='content'>Nigel: thanks, that helps, but my question remains: what specific Firefox bugs did they hit that makes them prefer Flash for Firefox users? I&#39;d like to know so we can fix them :-).

Maybe it was https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=713381, which we have a fix for ... but maybe it was something else.</div>

How about Mozilla asking retarded Rovio to remove the Flash dependency from Angry Birds &quot;HTML5&quot;? Sigh, all these retarded so called &quot;HTML5&quot; developers should not do any HTML5 work if they can&#39;t do it right in the first place.</div>

<div class='content'>I am exicited about HTML5 but Flash can do all these things <a href="html5audioplayer.org" rel="nofollow">html5 audio player</a> can do in a better way.Creating slideshow in HTML5! wow! what, flash did that 10 years ago! It is very easy to create a flash animation, for example a ball bouncing in flash professional in less than am minute. Javascript is a mess when compared to AS3.</div>
