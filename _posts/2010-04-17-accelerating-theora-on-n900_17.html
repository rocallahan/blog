<div class="columns"><p>Last year Mozilla funded development of <a href="http://www.schleef.org/blog/2009/11/11/theora-on-ti-c64x-dsp-and-omap3/">Leonora</a>, David Schleef's port of the Theora decoder to run on the TI C64x+ DSP that's found in the Nokia N900, Palm Pre, Motorola Droid and other mobile devices. Since then Matthew Gregan's spent some time working on integrating it into a complete player with actual video playback, sound, and A/V synchronization. The bottom line is that using Leonora and certain graphics acceleration tricks we can play full-screen video (800x480) with sound at 26 frames per second with the CPU 80% idle. This shows that free codecs can work well on mobile devices. Read <a href="http://blog.mjg.im/2010/04/16/theora-on-n900.html">Matthew's blog post</a> for the juicy details.</div><br/><br/>

<div class='content'>It just confirms that comment from some a google developer what I reported here earlier :<br>http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2010/04/interesting-times-for-video-on-web.html#c8044969807598232563<br>Theora can already playback in real time on an iPhone 3GS at native screen resolution, 25 fps [...] Hardware decode support is a red herring.<br>I&#39;m getting a Droid soon, I&#39;d love to play with that code ...<br></div>
