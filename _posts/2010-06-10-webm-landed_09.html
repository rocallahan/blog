<p>Our initial WebM support <a href="http://blog.pearce.org.nz/2010/06/webm-has-landed-on-firefox-nightlies.html">has landed</a> on mozilla-central. The main holdup was ensuring that Google's VP8 source license was GPL-compatible; that has now <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/391073/">been resolved</a> to everyone's satisfaction. Good stuff!<br/><p>Of course, this is only the beginning. Currently we're working on support for the 'buffered' attribute, and there are many other bug fixes and improvements to make.<br/><br/>
