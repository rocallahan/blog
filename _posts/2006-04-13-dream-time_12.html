<div class="columns">I have interesting dreams. Many involve the end of the world in various kinds of techno-apocalypse. Last night's was different.<br/><br/>Last night I visited a digital commune in Silicon Valley. Many people lived in a huge and lovely building, always online and connected to an all-encompassing wiki/blogs/social networking system. Cameras and sensors fed data upstream, and in turn the system regulated downstream behaviour, every action and interaction a shadow of an online transaction. I wandered around, disconnected, irrelevant to its participants.<br/><br/>Sometimes the feed from one camera seemed to catch the attention of the entire community, the people nearby would point to it, and there'd be a rush to see who could touch it first, no matter how inaccessible. People spontaneously formed structures, piling up to lift someone's finger to a great height. Now it reminds me of the Sistine Chapel.<br/><br/>The system broke down. On screens that tracked the status of community members, I could see people disconnecting, losing karma. A confused crowd gathered in a large hall and was addressed by a group of leaders. I looked on from a distance, discussing with another observer, inexplicably Andrew Appel. There was an air of finality, of an experiment that failed.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what it all means. It smelled like Google, Orkut and 1984. It did, however, make a nice change from being hunted by robots.</div><br/><br/>

<div class='content'>You&#39;ve dreamed part of an ancient prediction... &quot;many will be offended, will betray one another, and will hate one another...and because lawlessness will abound, the love of many will grow cold.&quot;<br>Unfortunately, we live in a world that maximizes opportunity for offense. That&#39;s a relational downside of micro-indexing all communication. (Just wait until audio tracks can be googled! Then you&#39;ll be able to _prove_ that Jane WorldChanger dissed Islam during an obscure 1980 talk in a rural community meeting?!!)<br>We&#39;re working on ideas to make eSpeech more gracious by nature... needs much prayer.<br></div>
