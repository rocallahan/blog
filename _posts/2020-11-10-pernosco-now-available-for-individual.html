<p>We're pleased to announce that <a href="https://pernos.co">Pernosco</a> is <a href="https://pernos.co/account">now available</a> to individual developers!
<p>Each Github account gets five free submissions. After that you can subscribe for 20 USD per month for 5 submissions per month or 30 USD for 5 "carry-over" submissions that don't expire. Workflow: make a recording with <a href="https://rr-project.org">rr</a>, then submit the recording to Pernosco with the <a href="https://github.com/Pernosco/pernosco-submit">pernosco-submit</a> tool and credentials obtained from the Pernosco <a href="https://pernos.co/account">account page</a>.
<p>Pernosco supports x86-64 ELF binaries with DWARF debuginfo &mdash; e.g. C/C++/Rust &mdash; and V8 JS (in some configurations, e.g. Node, <a href="https://github.com/Pernosco/pernosco/wiki/Chromium-Tips">Chromium</a>).
<p>Experience <a href="https://pernos.co/about/overview">how much better</a> debugging can be, and <a href="https://pernos.co/contact/">contact us</a> with any questions!
<p><strong>Update</strong> We've added a new "volume subscription plan" for individual users: 50 submissions per month for $50. This should make it easier to not think about rationing.
