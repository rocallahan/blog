<div class="columns"><p>There's a lot of press these days about the HTML5 &lt;video&gt; tag and the struggle for universal unencumbered video and audio codecs --- much of it associated with the Firefox 3.5 launch. I wonder how many people know that the Firefox video implementation is almost entirely due to just a few people in the Mozilla office in Newmarket --- Chris Double, Matthew Gregan, Chris Pearce, and to a lesser extent, me. (Justin Dolske did the controls UI, but I'm not sure where he lives!) I'm proud that we managed to get considerably more done for the 3.5 release than I expected.<br/><p>It's a great privilege to have the opportunity to really shake up the world for the better, with a very small team, in a relatively small amount of time, and do it right here in Auckland. I'm very thankful.</div><br/><div class="image"><img alt="Chris Pearce, Chris Double and Matthew Gregan" src="/assets/images/VideoCrew.jpg" width="800" height="600"/></div><br/><br/>

<div class='content'>I know that you are not on this photo so I guess it&#39;s Chris Double, Matthew Gregan, Chris Pearce there. Did you list them from left to right? It would be interesting to associate some faces with these names ;)<br></div>

<div class='content'>Just as a point of reference, what are the minimal tested hardware requirements for the built-in Firefox 3.5 codecs? I&#39;m using a now obsolete AMD Turion 1.6GHz uni-processor which has at least SSE2 support, 1MB L2 cache, on a notebook with 2GB memory running Windows XP; my download internet connection is about 500KBytes/sec max. (modulo other factors). Yet the introductory video (the multilingual &quot;Thank you for upgrading...&quot;, mozilla.com&#39;s &quot;What&#39;s new in 3.5&quot; page) still stutters with the CPU mostly pegged 100%. Is my hardware simply too wimpy?<br></div>

<div class='content'>I should note that while I did the controls&#39; implementation, Jennifer Boriss did the visual design. We&#39;re both in Mountain View. :-)<br></div>
