<p>Pretty good movie. A few observations... (Spoilers!)
<p>I don't know what the ultra-rich really get up to, but for me the most absurd part of the movie was the MJ scene. Eleanor's early hand was trash; there was no way she she could have amassed the pungs-and-bamboos winning hand she did, not with Rachel also collecting bamboos.
<p>Maybe I misunderstood everything, but didn't the Astrid-Michael subplot undermine the main plot by proving Eleanor was right all along? Michael and Astrid set aside their different backgrounds and family disapproval to marry (presumably for love), but Michael couldn't cope with the pressure and ruins their marriage ... just like Eleanor fears will happen with Rachel. Main plot: true love wins! Subplot: ... er no it doesn't.
<p>The entire movie screams "FIRST WORLD PROBLEMS". In particular the idea that a man like Michael could not simply be grateful for his situation is marginally plausible but nearly unforgivable.
<p>My source tells me the actors' Cantonese was pretty bad.
<p>I'd watch Michelle Yeoh read the phone book.
