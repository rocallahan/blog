<p>During the weekend my children and I, plus some people from church and a friend, went tramping to the Pinnacles hut in Kauaeranga Valley in the Coromandel peninsula (near Thames, about two hours drive from Auckland). The weather was wet but the misty environment had its own delicate beauty. We only got rained on for about 45 minutes of the walk so everyone still had a good time. We played some good games of <em>Bang</em> and <em>Dutch Blitz</em> and, since it was only a single night, we brought real food and ate well!
