<p>I just got back from a children's sports club dinner where I hardly knew anyone and apparently I was seated with the other social leftovers. It turned out the woman next to me was very nice and we had a long conversation. She was excited to hear that I do computer science and software development, and mentioned that her daughter is starting university next year and strongly considering CS. I gave my standard pitch about why CS is a wonderful career path --- hope I didn't lay it on too thick. The daughter apparently is interested in computers and good at maths, and her teachers think she has a "logical mind", so that all sounded promising and I said so. But then the mother started talking about how that "logical mind" wasn't really a girly thing and asking whether the daughter might be better doing something softer like design. I pushed back and asked her not to make assumptions about what women and men might enjoy or be capable of, and mentioned a few of the women I've known who are extremely capable at hard-core CS. I pointed out that while CS isn't for everyone and I think people should try to find work they're passionate about, the demand and rewards are often greater for people in more technical roles.
<p>This isn't the first time I've encountered mothers to a greater or lesser extent steering their daughters away from more technical roles. I've done a fair number of talks in high schools promoting CS careers, but at least for girls maybe targeting their parents somehow would also be worth doing.
<p>I'll send this family some links to Playcanvas and other programming resources and hope that they, plus my sales pitch, will make a difference. One of the difficulties here is that you never know or find out whether what you did matters.

<div class='content'>I used to sale CS to youth, but, turn out, I stop it after one time I encouraged a junior in the college years.  I have learned if I am not sure that someone has strong passion in CS, not only THINKING it FUN, I don&#39;t encourage him/her to study CS.  Without passion, people very likely fall to discouraged and frustrated.  They may get a better life and good at if they choose other types of careers.  So, I don&#39;t sale to people by telling them the demand and rewards, because it is very likely to mislead youth and their parents to choose a career that he don&#39;t really interest.

<div class='content'>As I said, I encourage people to find something they&#39;re passionate about. However, for people who haven&#39;t already latched onto something, CS is worth trying, and the demand and rewards are part of the reason why.</div>

<div class='content'>Ouch. Yeah, that&#39;s the last thing the IT world needs... well-meaning parents steering children back towards the stereotypes we want to break. If it&#39;s something that interests them, encourage it!</div>
