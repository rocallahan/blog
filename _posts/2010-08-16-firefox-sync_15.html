<div class="columns"><p>I just tried using Firefox Sync to synchronize data between my main Firefox profile and my newly-installed home computer's Firefox profile. It was easy to set up and worked perfectly --- and it was fast too! I have to confess my expectations were not high for a feature that just got turned on for beta 4 :-). Well done everyone! This is definitely going to make my life a little easier.</div><br/><br/>

<div class='content'>I&#39;ve used Sync from way back in it&#39;s pre-1.0 Weave days. It had many trials and tribulations prior to being integrated into the browser. It does not surprise me that the integration has had only a few &quot;hiccups&quot;.<br></div>

<div class='content'>Firefox Sync is not the state of art.<br>Other extensions permit to sybchronize differents bookmarks folders and to choose then in every profile. I have my work bookmark and my free time bookmarks and they have not to mix.<br></div>
