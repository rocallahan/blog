<div class="columns"><p>Today the weather was mostly fine with occasional rain, but since Auckland is "who dares, wins" weather-wise we took off with some friends to the Upper Nihotupu Dam in the Waitakere ranges, about 45 minutes drive west of the CBD.<br/><p>Our family visited the dam a couple of months ago, and at that time it was half-empty --- about ten metres of exposed bank between the high water mark and the waterline. I guess they've had plenty of rain in the Waitakeres recently because today the lake was absolutely full. In fact the spillway was operating, which was quite spectacular! (See below.)<br/><p>It's about a 40 minute walk each way from the car park (on the Piha road just after it turns off Scenic Drive) to the dam, mostly along a service road. We got showered on lightly at one point but otherwise the weather was excellent, clear and sunny. Recent rain actually made the site particularly attractive --- apart from the operating spillway, the bush was most irriguous and streams and waterfalls were running high.</div><br/><div class="image"><img alt="NihotupuSpillway.jpg" src="/assets/images/NihotupuSpillway.jpg" width="800" height="600"/></div><br/><br/>
