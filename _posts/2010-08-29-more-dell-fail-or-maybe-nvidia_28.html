<div class="columns"><p>I bought a Dell ST2410 monitor for my new home computer (a Dell XPS 8100 shipped with an NVidia GTX260 graphics card, which has two DVI ports). Dell shipped a VGA cable and a DVI-VGA converter, so I thought I'd go out and buy a digital connector. Dell shipped me a DVI-HDMI converter dongle (made by NVidia apparently), the Dell monitor has HDMI and my TV has HDMI so I thought I'd get an HDMI cable and this would be easy. Wrong. The monitor completely fails to detect any signal from the computer. I tried everything I can think of. Even my old Macbook Pro can drive the monitor through its DVI port, the DVI-HDMI dongle and the HDMI cable. So apart from the cable, which obviously works, we have here three parts all shipped by Dell that don't work together. Sigh. I guess I'll try a DVI cable next...</div><br/><br/>

<div class='content'>OFFTOPIC: sorry, couldn&#39;t find any contact information quickly, so I hope you don&#39;t mind that I post here:<br>The overview page is &#39;broken&#39; in Firefox 3.6.8 in the way that the lines between blog entries extend into the right bar with the calendar and older dates. It&#39;s hidden (most likely behind a background?) when you hover the calendar column though.<br>I thought you might be interested.<br>regards, Mic<br></div>

<div class='content'>I&#39;ve got Windows 7 and Fedora 13 dual-booting. It&#39;s not likely to be a driver issue, since I can&#39;t even get boot-up text mode to display on the screen.<br></div>

<div class='content'>Heh. I&#39;ve had the exact same problems with a Samsung monitor and a 13&quot; Macbook. 3 trips to Best Buy to buy 3 different cables and 3 different adaptors later I found out that Mini-DP -&gt; DVI -&gt; HDMI will somehow let everything talk to one another. And digging through Apple support all I found was that &quot;it must be a problem with the monitor&quot;. That&#39;s compared to my VAIO which has HDMI and VGA out and works with a plain old cable.<br>Anyway, there&#39;s headaches no matter which side of the fence you sit on... that is, unless you give all of your money to one company. Then things typically &quot;just work&quot;.<br></div>

<div class='content'>Don&#39;t blame Dell or nVidia. Blame HDMI. I&#39;ve had no end of trouble with HDMI cables and devices...<br></div>
