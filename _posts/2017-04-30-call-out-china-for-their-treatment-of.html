<p>Nothing really new <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/diplomacy/news/article.cfm?c_id=467&objectid=11847844">here</a> in the stories of North Korea's prison camps, but I think one important aspect is consistently underemphasized:
<blockquote><p>Several weeks later, guards and inmates were ordered to gather as the pair, their bodies battered from torture, were dragged back behind the barbed wire. <strong>They had been caught in China and returned to the repressive regime.</strong>
<p>"The two brothers were beheaded in front of everyone," said Lim. "They called everyone to watch as a warning not to flee. The other prisoners then had to throw stones at them."</blockquote>
<p>Rounding up North Korean escapees and sending them back for torture and execution is barbaric and indefensible and should be embarrassing to China and Chinese people. The escapees want to reach South Korea; surely NGOs could take them there at no greater cost or inconvenience to China than the current policy.
<p>It seems to me human rights organizations, news organizations and political leaders should be making this point at every opportunity ... but it rarely seems to come up. I don't know why.
