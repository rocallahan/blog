<div class="columns"><p>I had a very nice dinner at "Wildfire Churrascaria" courtesy of Microsoft. Lots of yummy, fatty, salty meat.<br/><p>I went to catch my bus and missed it by one minute. At 10:41pm, the next bus was at 11:10pm.<br/><p>Being impatient, instead of waiting for the next bus I ran home ... well, half-ran, half-walked ... 5.5km In 42 minutes. Not fast, but then I had a backpack full of Microsoft swag plus my laptop, and a belly full of meat. Faster than the bus anyway.</div><br/><br/>
