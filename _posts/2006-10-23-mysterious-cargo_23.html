<div class='content'>Definitely wind turbine blades.<br>I&#39;m regularly out on the water on The Solent (bit of the English Channel between the Isle of Wight and the British mainland) and I regularly see Bladerunner 1 and Bladerunner 2 making their trips from the fabrication facility on the Island across to the mainland carrying turbine blades exactly like those.<br>See http://www.iwight.com/isle_working/business/companies/micon.asp<br></div>
