<div class="columns"><p>PC World has <a href="http://pcworld.co.nz/pcworld/pcw.nsf/feature/94269088644B7679CC2573AC006924B6">an article</a> about standards-based video-on-the-Web with a few quotes from our own Chris Double. The quotes sound pretty good, congratulations Chris on surviving your encounter with the media.<br/><p>It's too bad PC World NZ didn't pick up on the local angle. I guess they're just serving up a syndicated story, and they probably would not even have known Chris is based here in Auckland anyway. (Big hint to any media types who might catch this blog!)</div><br/><br/>
