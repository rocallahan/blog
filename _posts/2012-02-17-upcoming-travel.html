<p>Our whole family is going to Europe soon. We're planning to leave Tuesday night (Feb 21) and return March 17. I will be mostly not working, and mostly offline, but expect to be checking email regularly and able to respond to some review requests and the occasional crisis. I'm planning to visit the new Mozilla London office on Tuesday February 28 and the Paris office on March 9 so I should get some work done on those days.
