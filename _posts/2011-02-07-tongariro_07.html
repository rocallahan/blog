<p>Two weeks ago I did the Tongariro Crossing walk with some family members. The weather on the day was excellent and we completed the walk in about seven and half hours at a leisurely pace. This is the third time I've done the walk and I still enjoy it very much.<br/><div class="image"><img title="Mount Ngarahoe wreathed in cloud" src="/assets/images/NgarahoeCloud.jpg" width="800" height="600"/></div><br/><div class="image"><img title="An unusual lava feature on the rim of Mount Tongariro's Red Crater" src="/assets/images/RedCraterLavaFeature.jpg" width="800" height="600"/></div><br/><br/>
