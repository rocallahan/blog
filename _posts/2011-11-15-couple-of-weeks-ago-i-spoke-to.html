<p>A couple of weeks ago I spoke to a Computerworld journalist on the phone. The <a href="http://computerworld.co.nz/news.nsf/news/mozillas-nz-boss-works-to-keep-the-web-wide-open">resulting</a> <a href="http://computerworld.co.nz/news.nsf/news/spread-of-universities-fails-to-create-critical-concentration-of-talent-ocallahan">articles</a> have now been published.
<p>These articles are pretty faithful to what I said. Great!

<div class='content'>Rob, on the issue you mention of attracting talent to NZ, I think another constraint is the cost of housing there relative to incomes. My 3 bed, 2.5 bath, double garage, split level home on roughly 1/5 acre in a nice Chicago suburb close to good schools is worth (guessing a little) about 250k and my mortgage rate is under 3%. Before the slump it was 330k. I&#39;d love to move back, maybe will one day, but it&#39;s pretty hard to justify under current market conditions and zoning policies.</div>

<div class='content'>I think that&#39;s specifically an Auckland problem. The rest of the country doesn&#39;t suffer from inflated housing prices nearly as much.</div>

<div class='content'>The problem is certainly most acute in Auckland - and that&#39;s significant in the context of the article, since as you point out concentration of talent is important in order to attract talent.

But I think it&#39;s a mistake to assume that this is just an Auckland issue. For NZ as a whole, the median house price in September was 350k (http://bit.ly/rr846S) - around US273k, while in the US, the Q3/2011 median single family house price was US170k (http://bit.ly/tSnJa1). 

That&#39;s a pretty big difference - and that&#39;s before you start thinking about relative incomes and interest rates, both of which also work against attracting people to NZ.</div>
