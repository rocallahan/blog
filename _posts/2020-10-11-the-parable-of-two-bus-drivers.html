<p>Two bus drivers were driving along a dangerous mountain road. The first bus driver drove very fast in a hurry to get to town. Many times their bus scraped the guardrails and nearly plunged off the road, but the driver was lucky and each time managed to get the bus under control.
<p>The second bus driver also wanted to get to town quickly, but was more afraid of plunging off the road, so drove a little slower. Their bus scraped the guardrails only a few times.
<p>The second bus reached the town a few minutes after the first bus. Many passengers on the second bus complained: "if only you had driven faster, we could have arrived in town at the same time as the first bus. Next time we will choose the first bus driver."
