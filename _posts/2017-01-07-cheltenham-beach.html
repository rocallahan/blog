<p>Today we drove to Devonport to walk around North Head and <a href="https://www.google.co.nz/maps/place/Cheltenham+Beach/@-36.8213703,174.8058622,16.5z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x6d0d37c9fec85d73:0xc32446a7030fbefb!8m2!3d-36.821597!4d174.8092095?hl=en">Cheltenham Beach</a>. It was a lovely summer day and Cheltenham Beach looked amazing, especially for a beach that's more or less in the heart of Auckland.
