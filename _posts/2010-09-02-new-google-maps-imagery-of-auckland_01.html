<div class="columns"><p>At some point relatively recently, Google added much higher-resolution images of Auckland to Google Maps.

<div class='content'>Yes, I noticed those a week or so, and they *are* amazing - such detail. The photos themselves aren&#39;t all that recent though - there&#39;s no sign of big projects like the new Newmarket viaduct or the Victoria Park tunnel, so it&#39;s got to be at least a year old...<br></div>
