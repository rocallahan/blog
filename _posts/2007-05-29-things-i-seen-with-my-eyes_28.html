<div class='content'>We&#39;d like to do out-of-process plugins. There are some problems, though, like scripability and running windowless. We should coordinate with Zack.<br></div>

<div class='content'>What libraries did you use for the Theora integration? I&#39;ve been doing some research about usable libraries for HTML5 media elements: http://wiki.mozilla.org/HTML5_Media_Elements<br></div>

<div class='content'>That all sounds pretty spiffy, roc! So who&#39;s working in the Auckland office now - you, Chris Double, and an unnamed contractor, as far as I can deduce from your posts? Is there anyone else, and will all these people join planet.m.o? That would be a good way to keep up with all the fun things they&#39;re doing, I think :-)<br></div>

<div class='content'>Sylvain, libogg, libtheora and libvorbis for the decoding of the theora data. Currently I&#39;ve not got sound going but portaudio is the likely library for that.<br></div>
