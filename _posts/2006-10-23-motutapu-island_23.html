<div class="columns">On Saturday we went out on my parents' boat for a day trip to <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=Auckland,+New+Zealand+(Auckland)&ie=UTF8&z=16&ll=-36.775235,174.898696&spn=0.010914,0.018883&t=k&om=1&iwloc=A">Motutapu Island</a>. The boat always brings back many precious memories to me, of spending a decent chunk of each summer holiday on it cruising around the islands of the Hauraki Gulf when I was growing up. The Gulf is one of the best things about Auckland. You can reach many wonderful places by ferry --- Rangitoto, Waiheke, Motuihe, Tiri Tiri Matangi, Kawau, Great Barrier --- but to make the most of it you definitely still need a boat of your own.<br/><p>Motutapu is adjacent to Rangitoto. The two islands are very different --- Rangitoto a brand-new volcano, barren and wild, Motutapo old sedimentary rock, grassy and operated as a farm, lovely in its own way. The Department of Conservation is gradually restoring Motutapu's forest cover, which is excellent although a very long term project.</div><br/><div class="image"><img src="/assets/images/MotutatpuValleyBottom.jpg" width="800" height="600"></div><br/><br/>
