<div class="columns">I always wonder why most people barely care about "nuclear proliferation". Is it because the name is so mundane? What would be a suitable chilling phrase to refer to the widespread acquisition of nuclear weapons by the petty, the bitter, the paranoid and the xenophobic?<br/><br/>Perhaps if the possibility kept more people awake at night, our leaders would give it more serious attention. Honestly, one of the main reasons I was (and am) against the war in Iraq is that it's distracted the world, and especially the USA, from the far more serious problem of North Korea. But I can hardly blame politicians for that when most of their voters could hardly care less. It seems inevitable that nothing much will be done until we lose a major city to terrorists or an accident. I expect it will be New York or Washington. Unfortunately by then it will be very hard to turn things around.</div><br/><br/>

<div class='content'>This is why I&#39;m a little dicey about being in London right now. I&#39;d hate to think that the politics of fear had reduced me to a quivering wreck, but it&#39;s clear that containment has failed.<br>All sorts of people have their hands on a 60 year old technology and it&#39;s only the matter of time before someone gets sufficently pissed off enough to use it somewhere.<br>Well-funded, wacky religious people seem to dominate the agenda from this point. And I thought I was more worried about the global economy!<br></div>
