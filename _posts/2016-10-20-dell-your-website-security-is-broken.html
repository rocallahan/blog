<p>You can download firmware and BIOS updates <a href="http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/04/Drivers/DriversDetails?driverId=VNMDK&fileId=3566241828&osCode=WT64A&productCode=xps-15-9550-laptop&languageCode=en&categoryId=BI">from Dell</a>. Unfortunately the download link is plain HTTP :-(. Fortunately the page provides SHA hashes for the download, which are even correct --- though I imagine practically no-one checks them. Unfortunately, the download page itself is plain HTTP so those hashes can't be trusted either :-(.
<p>Interestingly, the download page <em>is</em> available via HTTPS as well, but Google searches for "Dell bios update" etc point to the insecure version of the site. I have no idea why that would be.
