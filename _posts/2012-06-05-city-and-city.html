<p>I've just finished reading China Mi√©ville's <em>The City And The City</em>. It's amazing. The premise is original and outrageous, and seems hard to sustain given he places it in the context of the real world, but he carries it through brilliantly. I've previously read his Bas-Lag novels; they were very good (if flawed); this is much better. Not only do I think it's a better book, but it doesn't creep me out the way Bas-Lag does.
