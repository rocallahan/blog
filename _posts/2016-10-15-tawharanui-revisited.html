<p>Today I visited Tawharanui peninsula again with some friends and family. The weather wasn't great --- it was a bit wet, windy and cold at times --- but it was still a good trip.
<p>Tawharanui is protected by a predator-proof fence, and has populations of some of NZ's endangered native birds. We were lucky enough to see some North Island saddlebacks.
<p>At a lookout at the end of the peninsula we could see a number of extremely large "lion's mane" jellyfish in the water. These have also <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11727330">been washing up further north</a> recently. My parental vanity was gratified by my children immediately recalling the Sherlock Holmes story <em><a href="https://sherlock-holm.es/stories/pdf/a4/1-sided/lion.pdf">The Adventure Of The Lion's Mane</a></em>.

<div class='content'>One of my favorite places. I visit often when I&#39;m in the country during the summer. The loop out to the end and back around the south coast is a great workout.</div>
