<p>Well, sort of.
<p>I <a href="http://robert.ocallahan.org/2014/09/vmware-cpuid-conditional-branch.html">previously explained</a> how rr running in a VMWare guest encounters a VMWare bug where performance counters measuring conditional branches executed fail to count a conditional branch executed between a pair of CPUID instructions. Today a <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rr/issues/1577">helpful VWMare developer</a> confirmed that this is an issue caused by <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/atc12/atc12-final158.pdf">clever optimizations</a> in the virtual machine monitor. Better still, he provided an easy way to work around it! Just add
<pre>monitor_control.disable_hvsim_clusters = true</pre>
to your .vmx file. This may impact guest performance a little bit, but it will make rr work reliably in a VMWare guest, which should be useful to a lot of people. Excellent!
