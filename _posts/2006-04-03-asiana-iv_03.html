<div class="columns">One of the things that struck me when I first got back to Auckland last year was how great Auckland's Asian food is. Over the last year it has continued to impress.<br/><br/><em>Sunshine</em> remains the best yum cha in town in my opinion, and would be ranked among the best in North America. But there are many other quality places in Auckland. Just a short walk from our house is <em>Hee's Garden</em> on Mount Eden Road, which despite being a lone Chinese restaurant in what's practically the suburbs, and despite being of modest size, serves quality yum cha seven days a week. The selection isn't huge but what they do, they do well. <em>Dragon</em> on Eliot Street in town is also good.<br/><br/>Recently some friends introduced us to <em>Hansan</em> in Mount Wellington. Among car yards and strip malls, this place offers a big menu of cheap and really excellent Vietnamese food. They also have great milkshakes. Highly recommended.<br/><br/>Our family has been working our way up and down the dozens of restaurants along Dominion Road. There are a lot of cheap grease pits and MSG dispensers, but there are also places where you can have a good meal at a fair price and get free soup and dessert if you're lucky. We like <em>Love A Duck</em> and <em>Sum's Kitchen</em>.<br/><br/>In Newmarket we really like <em>Crazy Noodle</em>, which along with Chinese food offers Hong Kong style Western food. Toasted sandwhiches with condensed milk, baked fish on rice in curry sauce, that sort of thing. <em>Sunnytown</em> and <em>Sun World</em> are acceptable places for yum cha or dinner. <em>Gengy's</em> is a fun Mongolian BBQ place but either it's going downhill or we're tiring of it.<br/><br/>I still haven't made it to <em>Empress Garden</em>, which used to be a regular stop in my university days (12 years ago ... erp). I've heard good things about <em>Yum Cha</em> on Quay St. And <em>... something ... Pearl</em> in Newmarket, which we didn't like, has reopened as a steamboat restaurant so we'll have to check it out again. The one thing we haven't found yet is shabu shabu as good as <em>Minnie's</em> in Flushing, New York.</div><br/><br/>

<div class='content'>I&#39;d second that vote for Sunshine and also Hee&#39;s Garden (if that&#39;s the place we walked to right after climbing Mt Eden).  Both excellent, and comparable to the best I&#39;ve had in NYC or the South Bay.  I would&#39;ve liked to try Crazy Noodle --- maybe next time!<br></div>
