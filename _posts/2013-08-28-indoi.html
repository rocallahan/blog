<p>Indoi is a new Indian restaurant on Short St in Newmarket, very close to the Mozilla office. It's my favourite Indian restaurant in Newmarket. The non-vegetarian thali lunch special is $15, which is a very reasonable price for a very nice meal. I've concerned about their longevity though; I almost never see customers there other than our lunch group. It's probably partly the location; a lot of restaurants have come and gone there, Short St doesn't get much foot traffic, and the restaurants on Lumsden Green probably snap up a lot of the customers heading in that direction. My advice is to eat at Indoi before it shuts down!
