<p>This Friday evening I'm part of the panel for an open Q&A session at Auckland Chinese Presbyterian Church. It should be a lot of fun!

<div class='content'>The format was good and the questions were good. Whether the answers were good is not really for me to decide but I thought they were OK :-). Unfortunately hardly anyone turned up who wasn&#39;t already part of our church, so for whatever reason this event didn&#39;t appeal. We&#39;ll have to try something else next time.</div>
