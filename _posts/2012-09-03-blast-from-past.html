<p>I haven't sung this song for years, but Gen, bless her, brought it back on Sunday. Stuart Townsend nails the important points in a moving and personal way.

<blockquote><pre><em>How deep the Father's love for us,
How vast beyond all measure
That He should give His only Son
To make a wretch His treasure.

How great the pain of searing loss,
The Father turns His face away
As wounds which mar the chosen One,
Bring many sons to glory.

Behold the Man upon a cross,
My sin upon His shoulders;
Ashamed I hear my mocking voice,
Call out among the scoffers.

It was my sin that left Him there
Until it was accomplished;
His dying breath has brought me life
I know that it is finished.

I will not boast in anything:
No gifts, no power, no wisdom,
But I will boast in Jesus Christ
His death and resurrection.

Why should I gain from His reward?
I cannot give an answer.
But this I know with all my heart
His wounds have paid my ransom.</em></pre></blockquote>

<div class='content'>Thankyou, Robert, a very moving hymn. Can I refer you to the even older hymn by Isaac Watts(born 1674), &quot;When I Behold the Wondrous Cross.&quot; The theme, and some of the scriptural references, are the same. Timeless, and a work of poetic art. Bless you  - Maureen   </div>

<div class='content'>Love it. I think &quot;In Christ Alone&quot; tries to channel the flavour of that song.</div>
