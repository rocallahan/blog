<p>I gave this month's Auckland Rust Meetup talk: a <a href="/assets/images/Rust-Pernosco.pdf">very high-level overview of Pernosco's architecture</a> and then a dive into some superficial metrics about the project, comments on the third-party crates we use, and some thoughts about the pros and cons of Rust for this project. I apologise for the slides being thrown together in a hurry, and they're probably a bit hard to follow without my commentary.
