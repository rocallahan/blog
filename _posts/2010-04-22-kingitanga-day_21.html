<div class="columns"><p>Today I drove down to Hamilton for their <a href="http://www.waikato.ac.nz/events/kingitanga/">Kingitanga Day</a> celebrations. I was honoured to be invited to give a talk as one of the many events of the day. I gave another talk about <a href="/roc/images/ChangingTheWorld-Waikato.pdf">Changing The World</a>, but quite different from last week's keynote. In this talk I focused on Mozilla's efforts to change the world, and how we work as an open source community to make changes. I went on to talk about how and why people should contribute to open source communities in general. Most of the stuff in the talk was obvious to people who are familiar with Mozilla. I had a bit less time than usual so I had to race through the second half --- I hope that didn't put people off!<br/><p>After my talk was a talk by Stu Sharpe from Sidhe, a games development company in Wellington, about game development. It was pretty interesting --- nothing super surprising, but it's good to know that kind of work is being done in NZ.</div><br/><br/>
