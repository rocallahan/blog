<blockquote>My dear brothers and sisters, take note of this: Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry, because human anger does not produce the righteousness that God desires.</blockquote>
<p>Online media exploit the intoxicating effects of righteous anger to generate "engagement". But even &mdash; or especially &mdash; when the targets of one's anger richly deserve it, becoming a person whose life is characterized by anger is contrary to God's will.
<p>Something to remember when I'm tempted to click on yet another link about some villain getting what he deserves.
