<p>When interviewing athletes after an event, I want to know what they think, not what you think. So, why are you always making statements and inviting the subject to agree with you? Instead, ask open-ended questions.
<p><strong>Bad</strong>:
<ul>
<li>"It was tough at there for the last twenty minutes, wouldn't you say?"
<li>"It looked like you were completely calm at the start?"
</ul>
<p><strong>Good</strong>:
<ul>
<li>"What was the toughest part of the match?"
<li>"How did you feel at the start?"
</ul>
<p>Same goes for any other kind of interview, but sports interviewers irritate me the most.
