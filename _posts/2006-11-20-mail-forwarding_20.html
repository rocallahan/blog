<div class="columns"><p>For years I've been using <a href="zoneedit.com">Zoneedit</a>'s free service to forward mail for accounts @ocallahan.org to various destinations (currently <a href="http://gmail.com">GMail accounts</a>). Unfortunately Zoneedit's service seems to have deteriorated lately; many mails are delayed by half an hour or more inside Zoneedit's system, and I suspect one or more may have been dropped, although I can't prove that yet. Any readers have tips for a more reliable but free service to achieve the same thing? "Google Apps For Your Domain" is close, but apparently overkill for what I want since it seems to give you fresh GMail mailboxes for the domain email addresses, and I just want forwarding to existing accounts.<br/><p>The Firefox Summit was fantastic. I met literally dozens of people I've worked with for years but never met face to face, and I had lots of fun. I'll probably write more about it soon.<br/><p><strong>Update!</strong> On the advice of an anonymous commenter, I tried using Google Apps For Your Domain, setting up one "email list" per name@ocallahan.org, each containing one recipient, the address I want to forward to. It works great! Email propagation time is reduced from 10-30+ minutes to about ten seconds, and I only have had to create one extra GMail account (root@ocallahan.org, the administrator). Thanks Anonymous (and Google)!</div><br/><br/>

<div class='content'>I just got fed up with MyDomain.com&#39;s slow and unreliable forwarding. Found your post and switched to GAFYD. Setup was easy and test messages work fine. Thanks for the pointer!<br></div>

<div class='content'>Thanks for the recommendation.. I was also getting tired of 20-30 min deliveries (forwards) from zoneedit, and GAFYD seems to work perfectly!<br>For those wishing to forward all mail for your domain, just setup an account on GAFYD (e.g. admin), go into settings and configure that admin account as a catch-all.  Next, go into that admin&#39;s Gmail and set the forwarding there.<br>An added bonus is that I will have copies of all my mail in my Gmail for backup.<br>Thanks again.<br></div>

<div class='content'>I&#39;d recommend just web hosting.  Most give the option to setup forwards.  Also your own pop3 so you have reliable email without branding.  That&#39;s been my approach for years.  No regrets.<br></div>

<div class='content'>I have the same problem. Mails that don&#39;t get forwarded by zoneedit at all or delayed for at least half an hour. The mails that completely vanish are the most worrying ! Looks like I may have to drop zoneedit.</div>

<div class='content'>My e-mail has even been kept by ZoneEdit for *twelve* hours before they forwarded it. Although I still have some privacy reservations about Google, they may win the battle. Previously I used Mydomain which is the same trouble as ZE. Right now they are all owned by Dotster who seems to have bought the rights on e-mail delays. Not to mention that ZE helpdesk and admins totally ignore customers who complain, all you get out of them is &quot;one of our servers has been mail bombed and we have taken precautions so that we hope it will not happen again&quot; or &quot;we have ordered extra servers&quot;. I am giving up.<br></div>

<div class='content'>Thanks Anonymous, the Email List looks like a great way to do forwarding. I&#39;m setting up Google Apps For Your Domain now.<br></div>

<div class='content'>Well, if you used the Google Apps For Your Domain, you could just get the fresh GMail mailboxes to automatically forward all mail on to your current accounts.<br></div>

<div class='content'>As a former user of ZE&#39;s forwarding service who has now switched to GAFYD, I&#39;ll recommend that.  It may be a bit of &quot;overkill&quot; as you said, but you can just set things up so that everything is auto-forwarded to your current Gmail account.*  I have a friend who&#39;s in the same boat as you (he wants a better forwarding service, but didn&#39;t need fresh new accounts) who did just that.  The upside to this is that you theoretically have one less point of failure in your e-mail chain because instead of worrying about Gmail&#39;s servers working and some third-party&#39;s servers working, you just have to worry about Gmail&#39;s<br>* If you&#39;re not using catchalls, then it&#39;s easier to just set up a Google Apps &quot;Email List&quot; for each address that you want forwarded; otherwise, if you are using catchalls, set the catchall account to auto-forward e-mails from its account settings.<br></div>

<div class='content'>I&#39;m assuming this technique worked for you too! If so, glad to hear! I had only tested it out a couple of times so I wasn&#39;t sure it was working for others.
