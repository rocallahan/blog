<p>Forbes has an interesting <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/venkateshrao/2011/12/05/the-rise-of-developeronomics/">article</a>:
<blockquote>The one absolutely solid place to store your capital today — if you know how to do it –  is in software developers’ wallets. If the world survives looming financial apocalypse dangers at all, this is the one investment that will weather the storms. It doesn’t matter whether you are an individual or a corporation, or what corner of the world you inhabit. You need to find a way to invest in software developers.</blockquote>
<p>The whole article is rather over-the-top, in my opinion, but its points are mostly good and it's thought-provoking. It's also probably useful to point people at when they're considering career choices ... such as the parent I met who was worried that if her Linux-loving daughter became a developer, all those jobs might disappear in the recession. (Her daughter ended up not going into computer science; university counsellors steered her away from it, apparently :-(.)
