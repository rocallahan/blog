<div class="columns">Mike Connor <a href="http://steelgryphon.com/blog/?p=96">has blogged</a> about the Linux policy discussion we had during the summit and the conclusions we reached. I don't have much to add. Because Mozilla release schedules and distribution release schedules often aren't aligned, distributions are often adding features and non-security fixes to their branch builds. It will be very helpful to be able to share those changes between distributions via Mozilla CVS.<br/><p>We are going to have to deal with situations where one set of distributions wants only security fixes on a branch and other distributions want to ship features off that branch. I'm not quite sure how that's going to work yet.</div><br/><br/>
