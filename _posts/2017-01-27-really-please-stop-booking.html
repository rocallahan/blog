<p><a href="http://robert.ocallahan.org/2016/05/stop-booking-conferences-in-usa.html">Last year</a> I opined that international organizations should stop booking conferences in the USA in case Trump became President and followed through on his promise to ban Muslims from entering the country.
<p>That particular risk soared when he was unexpectedly elected, then decreased given he seems to have backtracked on a blanket Muslim ban. Still, it feels like almost anything could happen, and because conference locations have to be booked pretty far ahead, IMHO prudence still means preferring non-USA venues until the future becomes more clear. (The <em>pre-Trump</em> <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/foreign-travelers-social-media-232930">ESTA changes</a> asking for social media account data are also quite troubling. It makes me wonder whether I'm making trouble just posting this .. and I shouldn't have to.) 
<p>I especially suggest that if you're one of those people who sees Trump as a clear and present danger to American democracy and social order, it doesn't really make sense to be comfortable with organizing international conferences there.
<p>(To be clear: I'm not calling for some kind of boycott to punish Americans for making "the wrong choice". It's simply about making sure international conferences are as inclusive and congenial as possible.)
