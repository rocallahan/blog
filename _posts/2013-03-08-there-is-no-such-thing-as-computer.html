<p>Attention Boeing, US Department of Defense, and everyone else: Please stop automating your planes, armies, etc and connecting them to computer networks. Their security will fail and you will lose control of those assets, with dire consequences.
<p>Seriously, why can't everyone see this? Was Lockheed being hacked via RSA not a clear enough sign?
<p>It's US military's conversion to drones that worries me the most in this vein. There's some seriously asymmetric warfare coming.
