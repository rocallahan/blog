<blockquote><p>John McGlashan principal Michael Corkery said: "He was doing what every kid should be doing, playing with his friends in a river."
<p>Everybody had done everything right, but Dion still died.
<p>"It was just a tragedy, and tragedies happen. Life sometimes deals out bad luck but we have to get on with it. We'll never forget him."</blockquote>
<p>Too often, people respond to a child's tragic death by setting up a pressure group, foundation or new law to Make Sure This Never Happens Again.

What do you think of the &quot;Free range kids&quot; movement? http://freerangekids.wordpress.com/

Does it accord with your philosophy of risk?</div>

<div class='content'>I always find it ironic that these unlikely tragedies garner more attention than the very pedestrian occurrence of kids being killed in and by cars.  It&#39;s not that society has a low risk tolerance.  It just has a very bizarre sense of what is a risk.</div>
