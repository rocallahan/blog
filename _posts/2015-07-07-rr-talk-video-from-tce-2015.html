<p>The good people at the Technion have uploaded video of the <a href="http://tce.technion.ac.il/tce-conference-2015-program/">TCE 2015</a> talks, in particular video of my <a href="https://youtu.be/H4iNuufAe_8">rr talk</a>. <a href="http://tce.technion.ac.il/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2015/06/SC-5.3-R.-Ocallahan1.pdf">My slides</a> are also available. This is a fairly high-level talk describing the motivation and design of rr, delving into a few interesting details and concluding with a discussion of some of the exciting possibilities that could be enabled by rr and similar technology.
