<p>Inspired by <a href="http://www.figuiere.net/hub/blog/?2012/06/06/824-deleted-my-linkedin-account">others</a>, I just quit Linkedin. There was almost no value in it to me --- probably negative value to due to having to deal with their email. I am now a member of zero social-networking sites, which I find very satisfying.

<div class='content'>I don&#39;t blame you for leaving LinkedIn.  I found no value in it either.  Further, there is little value in any internet social networking site.  I don&#39;t see how sharing every bit of one&#39;s life does anything for a person other than makes them stop doing things and instead stating things.  I left Facebook, MySpace, LinkedIn, among others, and must say my life is much fuller as a result.

<div class='content'>Concerning social networks, not only I have to admit to having Twitter account, but even seriously contemplating closing identi.ca one, noice of shutters banging to windows of empty buildings is deafening...</div>

<div class='content'>there is no value in these websites. all they did was trick people into giving away their valuable content which should be posted at your OWN website and not on some social network. they cluttered the web with useless trash and nonsense, spyware, viruses, and made rich asshats even more richer.

wow, yay for social networks.</div>

<div class='content'>all of this pretense of being social-network-free is getting on my nerves. all of you belong to more &quot;social-networks&quot; that you can imagine. and unless you die, you can&#39;t escape any of them.

get of your high horses!</div>

<div class='content'>Quite obviously, when someone says they don&#39;t belong to any social network, they mean social-networking sites. In my case, I said &quot;social-free&quot; as a way of expressing disagreement with the notion that social-networking sites have a positive impact on socialization.</div>
