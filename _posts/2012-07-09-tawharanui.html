<p>This weekend my family visited <a href="http://www.arc.govt.nz/parks/our-parks/parks-in-the-region/tawharanui/">Tawharanui Peninsula</a>. It was a brilliant winter's day --- cool but not cold, perfectly sunny, with a light breeze and amazing visibility; we could see distant islands that you can't normally see from this region. We walked from Anchor Bay along the North Coast and Tokatu Point tracks to the end of the peninsula, then back through the bush via Fisherman's Track to Anchor Bay.
<p>It reminded me a lot of the other Auckland peninsula parks <a href="http://www.arc.govt.nz/parks/our-parks/parks-in-the-region/shakespear/">Shakespear</a> and <a href="http://www.arc.govt.nz/parks/our-parks/parks-in-the-region/duder/">Duder</a> (also highly recommended, although I think Tawharanui tops them :-) ).
