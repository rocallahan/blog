<p>For a long time, rr has not been a Mozilla project in practice, so we have worked with Mozilla to move it to an independent Github organization. The repository is now at <a href="https://github.com/rr-debugger/rr">https://github.com/rr-debugger/rr</a>. Update your git remotes!
<p>This gives us a bit more operational flexibility for the future because we don't need Mozilla to assist in making certain kinds of Github changes.
<p>There have been no changes in intellectual property ownership. rr contributions made by Mozilla employees and contractors remain copyrighted by Mozilla. I will always be extremely grateful for the investment Mozilla made to create rr!
<p>For now, the owners of the <em>rr-debugger</em> organisation will be me (Robert O'Callahan), Kyle Huey, and Keno Fischer (of Julia fame, who has been a prolific contributor to rr).
