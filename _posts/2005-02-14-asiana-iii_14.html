<div class="columns"><br/>Over the weekend we went looking for Chinese shops in Howick and Pakuranga, where lots of Asian immigrants live. Mostly by luck we located the <a href="http://www.auckland.gen.nz/sommerville/">Somerville shopping centre</a>, which has about 50 mostly Chinese restaurants and other vendors. Very cool and lots to explore. We ended up at <b>Peninsula Cafe</b>, a Hong Kong-style cafe where we had a delicious meal of ox-brisket on fried noodles and pork schnitzel. The milkshake with crushed pineapple was new to me, and I recommend it! Too bad it's all about 30 minutes drive from home.<br/><br/>On Saturday we had yumcha lunch at <b>Sunshine</b> with family. I continue to be impressed and I'm quite confident it's better than anything in New York.<br/><br/>I forgot to mention that last weekend we had lunch at <b>Happy Valley</b> in Newmarket, yet another Hong Kong-style cafe. It was Janet's favourite place when she lived here ten years ago, and it's still in good form. Recommended.<br/></div><br/><br/>
