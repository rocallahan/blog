<p>A couple of weeks ago on a lovely winter's day our family drove out to <a href="http://www.arc.govt.nz/parks/our-parks/parks-in-the-region/muriwai/">Muriwai</a> for a walk. I can't remember going there before although I might have visited in my childhood and forgotten. We'd been to all the other easily accessed beaches on the west coast of the Auckland region, but not this one. I was a bit surprised to discover that Muriwai is probably the most easily accessed of them all --- less than 40 minutes from downtown Auckland. I guess that's because you don't have to traverse the winding roads of the Waitakere Ranges.
<p>I think it's just a little less spectacular than Whatipu or Piha, but still lovely. Between October and February the gannets are nesting at their colony, which must be amazing, so we'll have to go back then.

<div class='content'>Hey Robert,

Another kiwi here, who knows Muriwai quite well (Grew up in Helensville and still haunt the place from time to time)

I feel more people should know about this gem on the west coast - and you&#39;re right, the gannet colony is amazing during summer.

Cheers for the blog (saw it on planet mozilla)!</div>

<div class='content'>Beautiful shots. You don&#39;t by any chance have high-res ones under an appropriate license for reuse, do you? The second in particular would make for a fantastic desktop background.</div>
