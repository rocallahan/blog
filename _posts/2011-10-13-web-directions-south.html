Today and tomorrow I'm going to be at Web Directions South in Sydney. Today I'm giving a talk about the importance of Web standards in light of the challenges to the Web from mobile application platforms, and also platforms that are based on Web technology but "privatized" by various means (such as Windows 8, the Chrome app store, and Webkit-only mobile Web sites). It should be fun!
