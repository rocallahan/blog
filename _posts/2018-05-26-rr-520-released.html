<p>I released <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rr/releases/tag/5.2.0">rr 5.2.0</a>. This is a minor update that fixes some bugs, improves chaos mode a bit, and adds <a href="https://robert.ocallahan.org/2018/04/cpuid-features-xsave-and-rr-trace.html">some features</a> to help with trace portability. If rr's working for you, you probably don't need to upgrade.
