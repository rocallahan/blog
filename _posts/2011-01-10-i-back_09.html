<div class="columns"><p>I just got back from a magical five days of boating with extended family. We spent most of the time on the west coast of the Coromandel Peninsula --- Te Kouma harbour, offshore islands, visiting Coromandel town. The weather was superb, and we did everything --- swimming, fishing, walking, eating, reading, rowing, playing.<br/><p>Spending a lot of time in the hot sun and swimming in the sea three times a day --- and no showers --- for five days makes me feel invigorated.</div><br/><div class="image"><img title="View from Waimate Island towards the Wyuna peninsula and the Coromandel Ranges" src="/assets/images/Waimate.JPG" width="800" height="600"/></div><br/><br><br/><div class="image"><img title="Me on the beach at Rangipukea Island" src="/assets/images/Rangipukea.JPG" width="800" height="600"/></div><br/><br/>
