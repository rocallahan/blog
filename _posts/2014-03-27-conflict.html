<p>I was standing in a long line of people waiting to get their passports
checked before departing Auckland to the USA. A man pushed into the line ahead
of me. People around me sighed and muttered, but no-one did anything. This
triggered my "if no-one else is willing to act, it's up to me" instinct, so I
started a conversation:
<p><strong>Roc</strong>: Shouldn't you go to the back of the line?<br>
<strong>Man</strong>: I'm in a hurry to get to my flight.<br>
<small>There are only two flights to the USA in the immediate future and AFAIK
neither of them is imminent.</small><br>
<strong>Roc</strong>: Which flight are you on?<br>
<strong>Man</strong>: What's the big deal? I'm hardly going to slow you down.<br>
<strong>Roc</strong>: But it's rude.<br>
<strong>Man</strong>: So what do you want me to do?<br>
<strong>Roc</strong>: I want you to move to the back of the line.<br>
<strong>Man</strong>: You're going to have to make me.<br>
<p>At that point I couldn't think of anything to say or do so I let it go. It
turned out that he was on my flight and it would have been unpleasant if he'd
ended up sitting next to me.
<p>I was a bit shocked by this incident, though I probably shouldn't have been.
This kind of unapologetic rudeness is not something I encounter very often from
strangers in face-to-face situations. I guess that means I'm fortunate.
Surprisingly I felt quite calm during the conversation and only felt rage
later.
<p>Embarrassingly-much-later, it dawned on me that Jesus wants me to forgive
this man. I am now making the effort to do so.

<div class='content'>What&#39;s the point of forgiving that man, when he clearly didn&#39;t show any regret on his behavior? Apparently, he didn&#39;t think what he was doing was wrong or something.
And it is clear that his bullying behavior has benefited him.</div>

<div class='content'>That&#39;s a good question.

A simple answer is it&#39;s pretty clear in the Bible that Jesus wants us to forgive other people&#39;s sin when they sin against us ... so that&#39;s what I&#39;m beholden to do whether I understand why or not.

Digging deeper, we Christians are supposed to forgive other people as a reaction to God forgiving our sins. When we decline to forgive, it&#39;s a failure to appreciate the seriousness of our own sin or the value of God&#39;s forgiveness.

So it&#39;s not really about &quot;that man&quot; at all :-).</div>
