<div class="columns"><br/><p>This is it. After more than ten years living in the USA, and three and a half years working at IBM Research, I'm heading home to a new job in New Zealand!<br/><br/><p>There's so much to say that I don't know where to start. I love my job and we deeply enjoy our lives here in New York. But over time the desire to be with our extended family, and to be in New Zealand, has kept on growing. My desire to commit full time to Mozilla has grown. So we looked for opportunities, and God has opened doors, and now is the right time to walk through one.<br/><br/><p>I've started this blog for several reasons, but the main reasons are to keep in touch with my friends around the world, to communicate with the Mozilla community about my work, and to record the experiences of a high-tech expat moving back to New Zealand --- partly in the hope that others will follow.<br/><br/><p>Our actual move happens in early January. We'll be very busy until then, but I plan to write more about my background and why we're moving.<br/></div><br/><br/>
