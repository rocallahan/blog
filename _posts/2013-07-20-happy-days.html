<p>I gave permission from a writer to use an old wedding photo of ours for <a href="http://land8.com/profiles/blogs/new-plans-for-the-royal-botanic-gardens-sydney">a story</a>.
<p>We got married in Sydney because that's where my wife was living at the time --- I was at CMU in Pittsburgh. We had the ceremony in the morning and the reception in the evening so we had several hours in between to just roam around Sydney taking photos and having a good time. I think a lot of weddings are for the benefit of guests and the couple doesn't have such a great time, but we bucked that trend. It was definitely one of the best days of my life.
<p>A lot of things have changed since then. Our marriage has had its issues but I'm very thankful that in most ways it's better than it's ever been, as we keep learning to be better at being married. We'll need to, for the challenges ahead!
