<div class="columns"><p>I arrived back in New Zealand this morning after a very smooth flight. I watched a couple of movies and slept for several hours with no effort --- thanks God.<br/><p>Overall it was a great trip. I got to catch up with old friends, including some unexpected visitors to the Bay Area. The time at Mozilla was very productive --- I think it was a good idea to pre-organize some meetings. I got to visit Stanford, for a change. And the OSQ retreat was fantastic, although I felt that I didn't have much new to contribute since my attendance last year --- especially since I gave two talks at Berkeley in January.<br/><p>It's great to be home though. The more I travel, the more I appreciate being here in Auckland. Even the small routines of daily life with my family seem like special blessings after I get back. Now I can settle down for a solid couple of months of work and play before the Firefox summit in July.<br/><p>My in-flight movie summary:<br/><ul><br/><li><em>There Will Be Blood</em><br>I love Daniel Day-Lewis and he was great in this movie, but despite a lot of great moments it just didn't hold together for me.<br/><li><em>I Am Legend</em><br>Routine.<br/><li><em>Awake</em><br>Remarkably good considering Jessica Alba and Hayden Christensen are in it. I just like twisty thrillers.<br/><li><em>American Gangster</em><br>Good genre piece.<br/><li><em>Batman Begins</em><br>Absolute rubbish. Christopher Nolan should be ashamed of himself. Not nearly as good as the first Batman movie.<br/></ul><br/></div><br/><br/>

<div class='content'>Still no in-flight browsing? What a pity. MoCo should take it in the cross-hair with embedded Firefox, get contracted with Boeing and Airbus (hi Mitchell). You would prefer the awesomeness to these Hollywood craps then.<br></div>

<div class='content'>&quot;Not nearly as good as the first Batman movie.&quot;<br>By &quot;the first Batman movie&quot; do you mean the one with Jack Nicholson and Michael Keaton?<br>&quot;Batman Begins&quot; was better for mine.<br>I haven&#39;t seen the newest one with heath Ledger though.<br></div>

<div class='content'>Jeff: yeah, I mean the one with Jack Nicholson. You&#39;re welcome to your opinion, even though it&#39;s wrong :-).<br></div>

<div class='content'>As an atheist, it was nice to see an atheist in &quot;I Am Legend,&quot; even if he had to utter the inevitable &quot;there may be something out there after all&quot; line, which, of course, everyone can agree with.<br></div>

<div class='content'>Neville didn&#39;t go out an atheist.  :-)<br>Not only that, the theist followed her divine directions to the salvation of the human race.<br></div>
