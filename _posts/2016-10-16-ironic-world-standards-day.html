<p>Apparently <a href="https://opensource.com/life/16/10/celebrating-open-standards-around-world">World Standards Day</a> is on October 14. Except <a href="https://ansi.org/meetings_events/WSW16/wsd.aspx">in the USA</a> it's celebrated on October 27 and <a href="http://www.scc.ca/en/news-events/events/2016-scc-awards-and-world-standards-day">in Canada</a> on October 5.
<p>Are they <em>trying</em> to be ironic?
