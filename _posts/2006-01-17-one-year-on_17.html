<div class="columns">Well, I've been back for a year.<br/><br/>Overall it's been everything I hoped it would be. We've revived relationships with friends and family that laid dormant for many years. We've settled into a new home and a new church, and made new friends. That kept us busy during the year but we've still had time to enjoy much of what Auckland has to offer. Work has been satisfying, exciting at times.<br/><br/>Over the coming year I'm looking forward to more of the same. Hopefully we will be more giving and less receiving, and dig deeper into relationships with friends and family. I'm also looking forward to some longer-range trips to explore more of this lovely region. A few friends from the USA will be visiting us, which should be wonderful.<br/><br/>Workwise, I'll continue hacking away along the lines I've previously talked about: eliminating widget and view hierarchies, and helping with other projects --- cairo, reflow branch, units. Novell will probably have me spend some more time on GNOME integration. I may also do some work on development tools. My travel options are a bit more flexible this year (US tax issues restricted me last year) and I'll probably visit the USA a couple of times. I'm sure it will all be fun.</div><br/><br/>
