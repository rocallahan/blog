I've been back for four weeks now. Have I woken up from the dream and seen that my visions of living New Zealand were cruel illusions, that I can't go home again? No! There are little annoyances but the broad strokes of life are as expected. Life here is very good and I am thankful.<br/><br/><img alt="View of the harbour from Hamilton Rd" src="/assets/images/images/Hamilton-Rd.jpg" width="800" height="600" title="View from our address on Hamilton Rd"/><br/><br/>
