<p>A few tips on computer science paper titles:
<p>Titles of the form <em>Catchy Project Name: What Our Project Is About</em> are stilted. Show some imagination.
<p>Titles of the form <em>Towards [Some Goal We Totally Failed To Reach]</em> are an obvious attempt to dress up failure as success. Don't do that.
<p>Do write bold papers about negative results. Call your paper <em>[Our Idea] Doesn't Work (And Here's Why)</em> and I'll be excited to read it.
<p><em>[Goal] Is Harder Than You Think</em> would also get my attention.
<p>If your paper title contains the word <em>Aristotelian</em>, I will never read your work again and skip the conference too --- but you get points for chutzpah.
<p><strong>Note</strong>: following this advice may harm your career. Consider a career where you don't have to publish or perish.
