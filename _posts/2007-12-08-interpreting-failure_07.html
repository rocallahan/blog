<div class="columns"><p>Big news in New Zealand today is <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/4/story.cfm?c_id=4&objectid=10480740">Graham Henry's reappointment as coach of the All Blacks</a>. This is big news given that the All Blacks recently fell out of the four-yearly Rugby World Cup at the quarter-final stage. It's the first time ever a coach who failed to win the World Cup has been reappointed. Remarkably, the majority of public opinion backs his reappointment.<br/><p>I think it's a great rejoinder to all those who think NZers are over-obsessed with rugby and World Cups in particular. I also think it's <a href="/2007/10/tragic_vindicat.html">remarkably rational</a> to concede that results are sometimes outside the coach's (or anyone's) control and that statistics are more meaningful than one-off results.<br/><p>Naturally, there are a lot of misguided people complaining both that Henry was too focused on the World Cup and that World Cup results are everything so he should have been sacked.</div><br/><br/>
