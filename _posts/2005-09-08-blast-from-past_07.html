<div class="columns">A few years ago, while at IBM, I did some work on dynamic data race detection for Java, in conjunction with some colleagues at the Watson lab (hi Manu, Jong, Vivek, Keunwoo, Alexey!). It culminated in a "hybrid race detector" that combined two previously distinct methods --- <em>lockset</em> and <em>happens-before</em> in a nice way. The work was published in PPoPP 2003.<br/><br/>I'm pleased to see that some people at Microsoft Research have picked up the idea and <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/research/pubs/view.aspx?type=Technical%20Report&id=907">extended it to analyse CLR programs</a>. It's great that people are carrying on with this line of work --- it feels good to have your ideas built upon. (Although many of the extensions they describe in the paper were actually present in our detector --- I probably didn't get around to writing about them in our paper.)</div><br/><br/>
