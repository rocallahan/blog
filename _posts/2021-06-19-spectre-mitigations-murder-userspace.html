<p>I just made <a href="https://github.com/rr-debugger/rr/commit/99d3d4173badf63071eb05259e113dd3a398c5cb">a performance improvement</a> to the (single-threaded) <tt>rr sources</tt> command to cache the results of <tt>access</tt> system calls checking for directory existence. It's a simple and very effective optimization on my Skylake, Linux 5.12 laptop:
<pre>Before:
[roc@localhost code]$ time rr sources ~/pernosco/main/test-tmp/basics-demo >& ~/tmp/output2
real	3m19.648s
user	1m9.157s
sys	2m9.416s

After:
[roc@localhost code]$ time rr sources  ~/pernosco/main/test-tmp/basics-demo >& ~/tmp/output2
real	0m36.160s
user	0m36.009s
sys	0m0.053s</pre>
<p>One interesting thing is that we cut the userspace execution time in half even though we're executing <em>more</em> userspace instructions than before. Frequent system calls actually slow down code execution in userspace. I assumed this was at least partly due to Spectre mitigations so I turned those off (with <tt>mitigations=off</tt>) and reran the test:
<pre>Before:
[roc@localhost code]$ time rr sources ~/pernosco/main/test-tmp/basics-demo >& ~/tmp/output2
real	2m5.776s
user	0m33.052s
sys	1m32.280s

After:
[roc@localhost code]$ time rr sources  ~/pernosco/main/test-tmp/basics-demo >& ~/tmp/output2
real	0m33.422s
user	0m32.934s
sys	0m0.110s</pre>
So those Spectre mitigations make pre-optimization userspace run <string>2x slower</string> (due to cache and TLB flushes I guess) and the whole workload overall 1.6x slower! Before Spectre mitigations, those system calls hardly slowed down userspace execution at all.
