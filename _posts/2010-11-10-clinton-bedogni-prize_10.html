<div class="columns"><p>Last night at the <a href="http://www.nzosa.org.nz/">New Zealand Open Source Awards</a> in Wellington I was honoured to be presented with the <a href="http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/our_department/Clinton_Bedogni/">Clinton Bedogni Prize  for Open Systems</a>. The prize is funded by an endowment from the Bedogni family to commemorate their son, who had a passion for Linux and open source.<br/><p>I explained to the audience that I love making software, and I'm actually amazed that people pay me to do it, and especially to then give the results away to the world! To get a prize on top of that is incredible :-). I went on to thank my wife for all the time I spent hacking on Gecko, especially during the first five years when it was strictly a hobby. Then I thanked the partners and family members of open source contributors everywhere for the same reason.</div><br/><div class="image"><img title="Me accepting the Bedogni Prize" src="/assets/images/NZOSA2010.jpg" width="800" height="600"/></div><br/><br/>

<div class='content'>I remember reading about the Clinton Bedogni Prize a few months ago, and thought it was a touching tribute from the parents to their lost son - you richly deserve to be the recipient for your long and important contributions to Open Source. Congratulations.<br></div>
