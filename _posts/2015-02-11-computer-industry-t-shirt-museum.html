<p>You can tell the story of the computer industry --- in great detail --- through T-shirts. The rise and fall of companies, projects and entire technologies can be tracked through the T-shirts produced to commemorate them. I have a small but fine collection of vintage shirts, including
<ul>
<li>PR1ME
<li>CMU Java Day 1996
<li>DEC SRC: "Turning theory into practice" (ironic, since they generally failed to do so)
<li>IBM: peace, love, Mozilla
<li>Mozilla 1.0 (dino head)
</ul>
<p>There are many classic shirts that I've seen or heard about, such as "The Apple engineer (unknown) has unexpectedly quit" from the inter-Jobsian era. I would love to see a T-shirt museum that captures these T-shirts for posterity and uses them to illustrate --- in a fun, visual way --- the progress of our industry. I'd be happy to donate any of my T-shirts. Why hasn't anyone done this?

<div class='content'>FWIW, I put up a gallery of my Mozilla gear (mostly T-shirts) on Flickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/kairo_at/sets/72157644035445187/

This is just Mozilla, not all of computer history, but I have a nice collection there...</div>

<div class='content'>There was a project last year at the Internet Archive, where you could donate your tech industry or conference tshirts, and they were making seat cushions out of them. The Archive&#39;s auditorium is in an old church with wooden pews. Not quite a museum, but fascinating to see!</div>
