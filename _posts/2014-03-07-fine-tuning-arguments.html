<p>I've been doing a little background reading and stumbled over this very interesting summary of <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.4647">arguments for fine-tuning of the universe</a>. The cosmology is a bit over my head but as far as I understand it, it matches other sources I've read. It doesn't reach any conclusions about what causes the fine-tuning but it does pose some interesting challenges to the multiverse explanation.

<div class='content'>I believe the main philosophic driver behind multiverse adoption is the fine-tuning of the universe. If one presumes a materialistic explanation of what we observe here, one must allow for many, many more dies to be cast for our one universe to get the precise settings it has. </div>
