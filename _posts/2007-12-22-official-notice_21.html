<div class="columns"><p>David Cunliffe was New Zealand's Minister of Telecommunications, IT and Immigration until he recently switched to Health. (Personally I would have stuck with IT!) I just found his <a href="http://www.labour.org.nz/our_mps/david_cunliffe/speeches/20071018_speech_address_to_open_source_award.html">speech at the Open Source Awards</a> on October 18. There's actually a great mention of our local Firefox operation!<br/><blockquote><p>Just imagine for a moment our world without open source.<br/><p>More than two-thirds of the websites out there would simply disappear. But then you probably wouldn't be able to find the remainder because most of major search engines use open source. And if you did, you wouldn't be able to use what has become many people's favourite browser, Firefox: a piece of software developed in large measure by New Zealanders and right here in New Zealand.</blockquote><br/><p>Cool! Well, "large measure" is probably a bit of an exaggeration but I'll let him off!</div><br/><br/>

<div class='content'>Very cool to see Mozilla mentioned by politicians!<br>We&#39;ll have to work hard in 2008 to make something similar happen in Japan ;)<br></div>
