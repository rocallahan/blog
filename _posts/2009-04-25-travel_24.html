<div class="columns"><p>On Sunday I'm heading off to California for the Mozilla Corporation all-hands meeting. I'll be in the Bay Area from Sunday afternoon until the evening of May 6, arriving back in NZ on the morning of May 8 thanks to crossing the date line. It should be fun! I'll be online at times and should be able to keep up with my regular code reviewing and other duties.</div><br/><br/>

<div class='content'>Have a good trip and make sure to convince Moz management to push SVG even harder (Firefox is way behind all* other browsers nowadays).<br>And as the Moz office is very near to it, don&#39;t forget to mention SVG Open. Call for participation: http://svgopen.org/2009/participate.shtml<br>* forgetting about IE, like more and more people do<br></div>
