<p>Apple has more than two hundred billion dollars in cash that they obviously have no idea what to do with. Impressing investors after the success of the iPhone is very difficult. Apple needs to make a huge investment in something truly world-changing that could be immensely lucrative. Cars and smart watches aren't going to be that. Fusion energy could be! Currently, investment in this area is relatively low compared to the potential payoff. Revolutionizing humanity's energy economy is a challenge worthy of Apple (and Apple's cash). It's risky, but Apple can afford to make a few big bets. And if not Apple, then who?
