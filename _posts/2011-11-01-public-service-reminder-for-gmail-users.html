<p>I was just reading the account of yet another victim of identity theft, whose GMail account was broken into. It's tragic, and preventable. If you have a smartphone, you really ought to set up <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/02/advanced-sign-in-security-for-your.html">GMail's two-factor authentication</a> <em>right now</em>. It works very well for me.
<p><strong>Update</strong> And encourage your GMail-using friends to do the same!

<div class='content'>Which works well unless you don&#39;t want to pay the outrageous rates for text messaging on your smartphone and have them blocked as a result.</div>

<div class='content'>If you’re charged for incoming text messages, you can install the Android, BlackBerry or iPhone Google Authenticator app, which doesn’t cost anything to run. New Zealand has free incoming text messages, so I use my old Nokia candy bar phone for two-factor authentication here.</div>

<div class='content'>I just use the Android authentication app, I didn&#39;t even consider the text message option.</div>

<div class='content'>Unfortunately, it looks like you&#39;re supposed to use an &quot;application-specific password&quot; if you want to use an IMAP client.  A couple of things:

1. It doesn&#39;t appear that you are allowed to set your own application-specific passwords.  I understand that Google doesn&#39;t want to leave this up to users, so as not to allow the weak passwords most are sure to use.  However:
2. The generated password is no more (and arguably less) secure than the one of my own choosing.

These wouldn&#39;t be so bad if it weren&#39;t for the Google-generated application-specific password being a hardly memorizable jumble of letters.  <em>This itself</em> wouldn&#39;t be so bad were it not the case that Google&#39;s expectation that I&#39;ll set Thunderbird to remember my password is incorrect.  Again, Google&#39;s expectations end up being the less secure one in this instance of the user-approach-versus-theirs showdown.</div>

<div class='content'>Colby: OK, but I think very few users will find themselves in your situation.</div>

<div class='content'>Robert: I wasn&#39;t trying to moan under any delusions that this is a common use case.

It does make me wonder though, how common of a use case is it for people who don&#39;t set the mail client on their phone, etc. to remember their password?  Certainly not the most common use case, but more common than mine above.  For that reason, two-factor authentication might even open them up to an even larger risk than they would normally be exposed to, since now access to their mobile device -&gt; access to their mail account when it didn&#39;t before.</div>

<div class='content'>This is really interesting but I&#39;ve not found where Google says that they&#39;re not going to use my cell phone number for any other purpose, including tracking / data collection. I really would rather not extend to my cell phone number further the graph of data about me that google knows.</div>
