<div class="columns"><p>I'm scheduled to give a talk at next month's <a href="http://webdesign.meetup.com/108/calendar/5763141/">Auckland Web meetup</a> --- about Firefox 3 stuff, of course. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nigel/archive/2007/05/15/super-duper-meetup-terabyte-firefox-and-silverlight.aspx">It turns out</a> that Nigel Parker from Microsoft will be at the same event giving the Silverlight pitch. When it comes to marketing, Nigel's a pro, so that should be interesting.<br/><p>The indomitable <a href="http://bluishcoder.co.nz">Chris Double</a> should be there with me and we will have some interesting demos to show, although perhaps less <em>flashy</em> than others :-). We'll want to strike the right balance, though, pushing not just Firefox but our message about the open Web.<br/><p>Anyway, it should be a fun evening!</div><br/><br/>

<div class='content'>Hi there.... Manzana&#39;s a specialist supplier of classroom solutions.  Just recently we&#39;re doing some work in Xool developing a classroom ap which you&#39;ll find really interesting.
