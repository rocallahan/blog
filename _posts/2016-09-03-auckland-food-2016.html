<p>Here are some places I like at the moment, valuing not just quality but also interest and value for money.
<ul>
<li><em>Uncle Man's</em> on Karangahape Road (Malaysian). Best roti in the city in my opinion. Just a little bit better than <em>Selera</em> and <em>Papa Rich</em>.
<li><em>Cafe Abyssinia</em> in Mt Roskill. The only Ethiopian food in Auckland that I know of.
<li><em>Kairali</em> in Royal Oak. Good cheap South Indian food.
<li><em>Jade Town</em> on Dominion Road. Uyghur food, i.e., far-western Chinese. Get there early, around 6pm, or their specials are sold out.
<li><em>Hog Heaven</em> in Newmarket. The pulled pork sandwich is delicious. Go there soon because there's not much traffic and I fear it has not long to live.
<li><em>Momotea</em> in Newmarket and elsewhere. Decent food but their real attraction is their Taiwanese-style drinks and desserts. I like the black sesame milkshake and the "Momo Redbean Ice", perhaps the only time I've found a dessert to be bigger than it looks on the menu.
<li><em>Viet Kitchen</em> on Dominion Road. The pork-and-prawn pancake is delicious.
<li><em>Hansan</em> in Newmarket and elsewhere. Nominally also Vietnamese, but a different style that I've been told is more Cambodian. I think the food's generally less good than <em>Viet Kitchen</em> but it has milkshakes and desserts which I greatly enjoy, especially the coconut-banana-sago pudding. 
<li><em>Tombo</em> in Newmarket, Korean-Japanese. The lunch boxes are good, and the dinner buffet is great, if a little overpriced.
<li><em>Smile Dessert</em> in Somerville. High-end Chinese dessert restaurant which also sells light meals. I like the walnut and black sesame soup.
<li><em>Dae Bak</em> in the city. Great value Korean BBQ buffet ($20 lunch, $22 dinner). A bit less variety than <em>Gangnam Style</em> in Takapuna, but cheaper, easier to get to, and a less cringe-worthy name.
</ul>
