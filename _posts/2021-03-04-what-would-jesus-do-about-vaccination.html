<p>My thoughts about COVID19 vaccination as a Christian are pretty simple (assuming the Pfizer vaccine or something similar):
<ul>
  <li>Is it safe for me?<br><strong>Yes</strong>. I'm not known to be allergic to vaccine components or immunologically compromised, and the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00290-x">safety data is solid</a>.
<li>If I get exposed to COVID19, will the vaccine stop me from getting infected and passing it on to people around me?<br><strong>Yes</strong>, almost certainly <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-21/pfizer-biontech-shot-stops-covid-s-spread-israeli-study-shows">per the data</a>.
<li>Knowing this, if I chose to not get vaccinated, caught COVID19, and infected people around me with COVID19, would I have disobeyed Jesus' command to <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2022%3A37-39&version=NIV">love my neighbour</a>?<br><strong>Yes</strong>.
<li>Is there any other way I can ensure I won't catch COVID19 and infect others?<br><strong>No</strong>.
<li>Are there any countervailing ethical issues with taking the vaccine?<br><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-vaccines-vatican/vatican-permits-use-of-covid-19-vaccines-made-using-aborted-foetal-tissue-idUKKBN28V1HV"><strong>No</strong></a>. None of the vaccines on offer are closely connected to abortion.
</ul>
<p>Thus it is pretty clearly God's will for me to be vaccinated.

<div class='content'>Same goes for the influenza vaccine, I guess.  

I&#39;m not sure that this line of reasoning is valid. It might be.  Perhaps as Christians it really is our obligation to be vaccinated, as you say.

But I&#39;m not sure.  It doesn&#39;t feel right.    </div>
