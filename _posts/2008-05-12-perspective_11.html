<div class="columns"><p>It's great to spend a whole day talking about computer science with someone who is far better at it than I am. It's super-great when she's a old friend. No other method for restoring humility is nearly as much fun.</div><br/><br/>

<div class='content'>Hmmm, I&#39;m not digging the column layout in this case.  I&#39;m on FF3 beta 5, and I&#39;m seeing this laid out in 5 one-line columns.<br>I guess that&#39;s probably how it was specified, but it does look pretty strange.<br></div>

<div class='content'>And who was it? A woman who is truly great at computer science deserves a bit of fame. Female students need role models.<br></div>

<div class='content'>Yeah, the layout is kind of awkward for these short posts... I think CSS3 needs something along the lines of &quot;min-column-height&quot;.<br></div>
