<p>Portland was one of the best Mozilla events I've ever attended --- possibly the very best. I say this despite the fact I had a cough the whole week (starting before I arrived), I had inadequate amounts of poor sleep, my social skills for large-group settings are meagre, and I fled the party when the music started.
<p>I feel great about Portland because I spent almost all of each workday talking to people and almost every discussion felt productive. In most work weeks I run out of interesting things to talk about and fall back to the laptop, and/or we have lengthy frustrating discussions where we can't solve a problem or can't reach an agreement, but that didn't really happen this time. Some of my conversations had disagreements, but either we had a constructive and efficient exchange of views or we actually reached consensus.
<p>A good example of the latter is a discussion I led about the future of painting in Gecko, in which I outlined a nebulous plan to fix the issues we currently have in painting and layer construction on the layout side. Bas brought up ideas about GPU-based painting which at first didn't seem to fit well with my plans, but later we were able to sketch a combined design that satisfies everything. I learned a lot in the process.
<p>Another discussion where I learned a lot was with Jason about using rr for record-and-replay JS debugging. Before last week I wasn't sure if it was feasible, but after brainstorming with Jason I think we've figured out how to do it in a straightforward (but clever) way.
<p>Portland also reemphasized to me just how excellent are the people in the Platform team, and other teams too. Just wandering around randomly, I'd almost immediately run into someone I think is amazing. We are outnumbered, but I find it hard to believe that anyone outguns us per capita.
<p>There were lots of great events and people that I missed and wish I hadn't (sorry Doug!), but I feel I made good use of the time so I have few regrets. For the same reason I wasn't bothered by the scheduling chaos. I hear some people felt sad that they missed out on activities, but as often in life, it's a mistake to focus on what you didn't do.
<p>During the week I reflected on my role in the project, finding the right ways to use the power I have, and getting older. I plan to blog about those a bit.
<p>I played board games every night, mostly Bang! and Catan. It was great fun but I probably should cut back a bit next time. Then again, for me it was a more effective way to meet interesting strangers than the organized mixer party event we had.
