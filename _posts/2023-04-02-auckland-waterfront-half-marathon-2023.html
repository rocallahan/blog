<p>This morning I did the Auckland Waterfront Half Marathon. I finished in <a href="https://results.runningevents.co.nz/result/waterfront/2023/2832">1:51:13</a> which is okay but a little bit disappointing given that this course is dead flat. I'm getting older and I have to accept that. It felt similar to my previous half marathons where I can maintain pace up until about 18km and then it becomes too hard, so I break into a walk/run pattern until the end. Still, a good workout and these events help incentivize me to keep the running up.
