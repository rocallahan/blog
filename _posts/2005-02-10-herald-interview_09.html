Adam Gifford <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/index.cfm?c_id=11&ObjectID=10010075">interviewed me for the Herald</a> on "open source as a career". I'm quite pleased with the results --- much more pleasant, and accurate, than my previous encounters with the press.<br/><br/><br/><br/>

<div class='content'>Apologies for this awful roundabout way of contacting you, but i could find no other. I&#39;m working on an Open Source project for the University of Auckland and we&#39;re looking for someone who can program in Python and hack Firefox for a project related to publishing for eLearning. Was wondering whether you might know someone who fits the bill and is interested in a fixed-term contract. Please contact me if you would like more info. Thanks, and again sorry for the &#39;off-topic&#39; blog comment. Regards, brent.<br></div>
