<div class="columns"><p>I'm in the middle of my current US trip. Last week I was in Mountain View for a Mozilla work week (lots of excitement). Last night I arrived in Pittsburgh, where I am about to go to the wedding of some friends and then hang around until Tuesday, when I'll have <a href="http://www.cylab.cmu.edu/news_events/events/2010/e_ocallahan_9_21_10.html">a talk</a> about browser development and my research wish list --- it'll be similar to my LFX talk. I'll be online on and off while in Pittsburgh, and back in the NZ office on Thursday (Wednesday for North Americans).<br/><p>Being in Pittsburgh again is great, it brings back lots of good memories.<br/><p>On the following Monday (September 27), I'm going on a holiday with my family. I will be out of the office until October 8. During that time I plan to be <strong>entirely offline</strong>. So I won't be on IRC, replying to email, doing reviews, or even checking <a href="http://arewefastyet.com/">AWFY</a>. I'm looking forward to it :-).</div><br/><br/>

<div class='content'>Have you lived in Pittsburgh and do you know the area? I&#39;m moving near there in a couple of weeks and am looking for a church community to join.<br>Have a great trip!<br></div>

<div class='content'>Do you mean your LFX talk, or did you present another, even better talk somewhere else? :)<br></div>

<div class='content'>Matt: when I lived in Pittsburgh I used to attend (and will attend tomorrow) the Pittsburgh Chinese Church congregation in Oakland. They have an English service and tend to attract students, plus there are former students who have settled down in Pittsburgh and have families now. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s worth a look.<br>Sid: I meant LFX. I&#39;ll fix the typo!<br></div>

<div class='content'>During that time I plan to be entirely offline<br>Good idea. I wouldn&#39;t quite go that far myself - I&#39;d generally try to find internet access every few days to keep in touch with family - but it&#39;s certainly good to spend some time out in the middle of nowhere, with no internet or cellphone reception.<br></div>
