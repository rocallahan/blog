<div class="columns">For a while things were going very well. The flight was good and I had a great weekend with friends here in California. Yesterday I went to IBM Almaden and had a lot of fun giving my talk and talking to some of the IBM researchers. There's some really cool Web-related, Firefox-related stuff going on there.<br/><br/>Then tragedy struck. Last night my laptop mysteriously died. It simply fails to boot with a "Fan Error". IBM's service people are shipping me a box with which I can ship it to them to be fixed. I have no idea if they'll actually be able to fix it and get it back to me before I leave California on Sunday. If not, I'm not sure what I'll do. I wonder why I can't take it somewhere to get it fixed quicker. The timing is terrible; it's significantly harder for me to get work done without it. I can however still meet up with people so I'll try to make the best of it.<br/><br/>I did have a good day today at the Mozilla Foundation offices, talking to people about a wide variety of things, and putting some faces to old names. I'm looking forward to more of that tomorrow.</div><br/><br/>

<div class='content'>Robert, nice chatting with you today. Looks like I don&#39;t have an email address for you. In any event, something I forgot to ask you about was this place: www.codescan.com. I thought you might know something about them.<br>Cheers,<br>-Ben<br></div>

<div class='content'>I can sympathize. My Toshiba Satellite has been, for months now, making a horrendous sound whenever the fan went. A couple of weeks it got really annoying so I opened it to see what part of the fan was grinding agains something.<br>When I opened it, I found that there is some kind of copper contraption that connects the CPU to the fan &quot;exhaust&quot;. It seems to me that the overall length of that copper arm has shrinked over the years.<br>Anyway,after closing up the laptop, I started seeing some &quot;colling system failure&quot; problems.  When running Linux, th suytem just shuts down because of this issue. During my vacation, I need to get it serviced.<br>In the meantime, I can only use the laptop on a corner table with a SuperTech-type fan blowing on the CPU constantly.<br>No fun.<br>L<br></div>

<div class='content'>Oof! That sucks.<br>Does that mean I should check your fix for https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=344184 in?<br></div>

<div class='content'>Martijn: you should always feel free to check in any of my approved patches :-)<br>Robert: Actually I just tried to upgrade to onsite service, but they can&#39;t send a tech because apparently they don&#39;t have necessary parts in stock anywhere in the USA. Hard to believe... I think I&#39;m just going to hang on to the laptop and keep calling them until the parts are in stock and I can schedule an onsite visit wherever I happen to be.<br></div>

<div class='content'>Should have asked if they can just send you a replacement fan unit, so you could swap it out yourself, it&#39;s not to bad (pretty much remove the keyboard, and palmrest, then the fan unit that sits on the mobo).  Another option is to upgrade to onsite repair (or go to a repair center nearby).  May pay a little more, but should be quicker.<br></div>

<div class='content'>I know what that&#39;s like... I had a similar experience with ibm... if you want the dirt on that, just send me an email.<br>They did take care of me... but it took a while, and a lot of frustration.  But in the end, they made up for it.<br>Just be vigilant and keep calling.<br></div>
