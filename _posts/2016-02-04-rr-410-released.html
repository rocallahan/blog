<p><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rr/releases/tag/4.1.0">This release</a> mainly improves replay performance dramatically, as I <a href="/2015/11/even-more-rr-replay-performance.html">documented</a> in November. It took a while to stabilize for release, partly because we ran into a kernel bug that caused rr tests (and sometimes real rr usage) to totally lock up machines. This release contains a workaround for that kernel bug. It also contains support for the gdb <tt>find</tt> command, and fixes for a number of other bugs.

<div class='content'>Unrelated to this release, but another thing that rr is really handy for: I needed to debug a gcc plugin. But &#39;gcc&#39; is just a driver script. I was previously hacking this in by renaming cc1plus to cc1plus.real, then making a shell script named cc1plus that runs cc1plus.real under gdb.

With rr, I can just rr record the toplevel invocation, then use rr ps and find the program I&#39;m looking for. Not really a big deal compared to the core rr functionality, but it&#39;s really handy.
