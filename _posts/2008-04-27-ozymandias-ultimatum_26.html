<div class='content'>Nothing about &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; feels particularly dated --- I just didn&#39;t like the movie. Welles did some great acting but I just found the whole thing tedious. When I&#39;ve heard other people rave about it, they&#39;ve focused on &quot;non-linear storytelling&quot; or novel aspects of the camerawork, which no doubt made it stunning at the time but are nothing special now.<br>It&#39;s not that I dislike old movies --- I adore &quot;Casablanca&quot;, which definitely *has* stood the test of time. In fact I think most old classics still hold up well.<br>So in fact my &quot;full list&quot; of such movies would be pretty short if I were to work it out. Looking at the AFI&#39;s &quot;top 10&quot; ( http://www.afi.com/tvevents/100years/movies.aspx ), I haven&#39;t seen &quot;On The Waterfront&quot; but of the others, only &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; I found disappointing.<br></div>

<div class='content'>Hrm...well, my guess is you would have found &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; boring in 1941 as well :). The film certainly wasn&#39;t popular with the public when it was first released, and I don&#39;t think that the non-linear narrative and camera work alone were radical enough to blow people&#39;s minds back then (part of the coolness of those things in the movie is how they actually don&#39;t draw attention to themselves but instead fit in pretty seamlessly). Anyway, finding &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; tedious is one thing (I know many people that feel that way), but I think saying it hasn&#39;t stood the test of time goes a bit far, since it&#39;s not like it was ever an extremely popular film. Totally with you on &quot;Casablanca&quot;, though :-)<br></div>
