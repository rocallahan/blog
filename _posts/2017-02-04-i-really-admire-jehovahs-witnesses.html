<p>... and other door-to-door evangelists.
<p>I just had a couple of JWs visit me. I always cut through the script by asking door-to-door evangelists who they're with. Anyone who won't tell me straight-up I'd shoo off immediately, but people generally are open about it. On hearing they were JWs, I confirmed that they don't believe Jesus is God and asked them what they make of John chapter 1. We fenced amicably about those issues a little bit and I think they decided I wasn't worth their time.
<p>Of course I think JWs are totally wrong about this key doctrine. However, I really admire the zeal and fortitude of anyone who does honest door-to-door evangelism, because I've done just enough of other kinds of evangelism to know how hard it would be. I believe that these people are at least partly motivated by genuine love for the lost. As Penn Jillette observed, if you think you've come across truth that's life-changing for everyone, only a coward or a criminal would fail to evangelize --- though door-to-door may not be the most effective approach.
<p>Regardless, bravo!

<div class='content'>As a Witness, I must thank you for being kind to those who visited you. Everyone holds their own beliefs, and we feel it necessary to share with others what we have come to know and love, but it makes it all that much better when we can speak to others and discuss amicably our differences.</div>

<div class='content'>Imagine, though, how heartbreaking it would be for them to realize the truth? Having your whole worldview break down from first principles! I experienced it years ago; I hope never again.

I really admire Christians. </div>
