<p>I just rewatched the movies for the first time in a long time. I had wondered whether my enthusiasm for them would have worn off, but no; I think they've aged extremely well (unlike some other classics). Watching the extended editions all together in one weekend is a great experience; the ending really pays off because you feel the epicness of the journey.
<p>My favourite movies leave me feeling, not excited or sad or vengeful, but heroically inspired, with a burning desire to go out and do great and noble deeds. Both the book and the movies give me that.
<p>Rewatching the Shire scenes having been to the Hobbiton set is pretty cool.
<p>The only sad part is that it drives home what a missed opportunity the Hobbit movies were.

He leaves me a feeling, not heroically inspired, but happy with what I have, and in harmony with nature. Not worrying much about the noble deeds of others, but act locally and humbly.
Without him, LotR is too serious.</div>

<div class='content'>+1 on Hobbit movies, but also it always makes me pissed off for missing “The Scouring of the Shire” chapter. But yes, it is the only large complaint I have against whole LotR.</div>
