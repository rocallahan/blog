<div class="columns"><p>Ian Hickson <a href="http://ln.hixie.ch/?start=1196942823&count=1">writes interesting stuff about the evolution of companies</a>. One quibble: what he describes is "evolution" only in a very loose sense. Evolution, even non-biological evolution, generally requires <em>reproduction</em> with heritable characteristics that affect fitness, and that doesn't seem to be present here. All we have here is <em>adaptation</em> IMHO.<br/><p>That aside, he's basically right: people have learned to adopt business models that can't easily be crushed by Microsoft, but they all have the weakness that a superior Microsoft product would hit them hard.<br/><p>He omits, though, that there are other things Microsoft could do (and is trying to do) that would also hit their competitors hard --- for example, patent assaults. And open-source isn't as immune from a cut-off-their-air-supply attack as I think he makes out.</div><br/><br/>

<div class='content'>&gt;&gt; Evolution ... requires reproduction<br>Companies/organizations can only adapt, but when a business model is copied, that business model has reproduced.<br>Evolution is so poorly defined (outside of science) that I think this easily qualifies.<br></div>

<div class='content'>Many companies, when searching for a product solution, will default to picking the MS solution.  Many companies will only choose other products either because MS doesn&#39;t have a solution or because MSes solution is desperately behind another major vendor.  I see this a lot in my workplace and have heard others notice the same thing in theirs.<br>This gives MS a major advantage over pretty much any other software vendor the produces a product that competes with MS.<br></div>

<div class='content'>Has the English language evolved so much that evolution doesn&#39;t mean the same thing anymore? :)<br></div>
