<div class="columns"><p>Last week I was interviewed by <a href="http://computerworld.co.nz">Computerworld NZ</a>. The <a href="http://computerworld.co.nz/news.nsf/spec/7C177AED05D2F193CC25728B0007706F">resulting article</a> is now online.<br/><p>I think it's actually a really good article, with just one mistake where I think I confused the reporter --- we're not the second development team outside Japan, of course, but the second outside North America, Japan being the other. I'm pleasantly surprised because my past interactions with the media have sometimes been really awful, and computer news often gets mangled by journalists who don't seem to understand what they're writing about. But this one is great. Thanks Ulrika!</div><br/><br/>
