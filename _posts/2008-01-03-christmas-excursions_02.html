<p>We've been out and about over the Christmas break. The weather has been fantastic. We spent nine days up north. We visited Matheson Bay:<br/><div class="image"><img alt="Matheson Bay" src="/assets/images/MathesonsBay.jpg" width="800" height="600"/></div><br/><p>The pohutukawas are stunning this year.<br/><p>The walk from the beach up by the creek is short but excellent.<br/><div class="image"><img alt="MathesonsCreek.jpg" src="/assets/images/MathesonsCreek.jpg" width="800" height="600"/></div><br/><p>Back in Auckland things are amazingly quiet, probably because everyone else is still out of town! Yesterday we went out to the Hunua Ranges for a walk and a picnic. (Until yesterday I'd only been there once or twice, barely remembered, which is silly given what a huge park it is within an hour of Auckland.) We visited the falls first:<br/><div class="image"><img alt="HunuaFalls.jpg" src="/assets/images/HunuaFalls.jpg" width="600" height="800"/></div><br/><p>Then we did the Cossey-Massey loop track up to the Cossey Dam and back. The ferns are particularly amazing. Apparently more than half of NZ fern species are present in the area.<br/><div class="image"><img alt="HunuaFerns.jpg" src="/assets/images/HunuaFerns.jpg" width="800" height="600"/></div><br/><p>One day I'd like to get into tramping and camping. That's the only way to explore the more remote parts of the Hunuas.<br/><br/>
