<p>Last week I was in California. It was my first time in the Mozilla SF office --- lovely view of the Bay from the roof. I always enjoy the free snacks and I'm always glad we don't have them in Auckland. I spent quality time with some of the people I know and love at Mozilla, and that's always exciting.
<p>On Wednesday and Thursday I was at Half Moon Bay doing LEAD training. It was fun, but thinking about "soft skills" for two days straight is quite draining for me; my social skills are learned, not innate.
<p>This cohort is different from previous cohorts --- most members are relatively new to Mozilla; of our cohort, Vlad and I have been at Mozilla the longest, by far. This gives me the honor and duty of representing the Mozilla old guard. I feel the power of the narrative that has me in the "crusty old engineer, harping about the old days and resisting change" role ... and I do my best to reject it :-).
<p>One of the results of LEAD so far is that I perceive my relationships with other Mozilla staff to be warmer and stronger than they perceive them, on average. I suspect this may be related to the difficulty of maintaining deep relationships with remote employees I see a few times a year at best. I'm still trying to figure that out.
<p>Plane movies:
<ul>
<li><em>Gangster Squad</em>: Genre flick. OK.
<li><em>Zero Dark Thirty</em>: Pretty good. Not exactly entertaining, but interesting.
<li><em>Live And Let Die</em>: Some kind of cross between a Bond movie, a blaxploitation flick, and the Dukes Of Hazzard. Odd.
<li><em>The Town</em>: Genre flick. Slightly better than average.
<li><em>I, Anna</em>: Sort of noir-ish psychological thriller. OK.
<li><em>Les Miserable</em>: The movie of the musical. Pretty good. I need to read the book sometime.
</ul>
<p>Interestingly, Air New Zealand <a href="http://www.airnewzealandife.com/rc/main/may-2013/">lets you see</a> what movies they're showing on their routes. This Web interface is a pretty faithful mockup of the actual in-seat interface (which is pretty bad ... it would be great to be able to see more than one movie title at a time).
<p>On Friday I leave for Taiwan for a week at the Mozilla office, a "Web rendering" work week. This should be even more fun than last week.

<div class='content'>Rob, it was a pleasure to meet you at LEAD. The training was a bit draining for me, too -- lots to absorb.

I was really glad to hear your thoughts on standards work and our engineering processes, though I definitely wouldn&#39;t characterize your stance as &quot;crusty old engineer&quot;! :)</div>

<div class='content'>The days are at their longest and it&#39;s time to get out and enjoy them. Because California has so many great summer events - and things that are just better at night. Such a nice post.</div>
