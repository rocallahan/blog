<p>Today Mike Hosking is saying that our lockdown was an overreaction.
<p>On March 23 he was <a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12318998">saying</a> "If we want to beat Covid-19, shut New Zealand down". "Michael Baker is right, we need to be shutting doors." No concern expressed about overreacting.
<p>March 24, after the lockdown was announced, he <a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12319309">wrote</a>: "Thank God we got there in the end". "My only real fear at this point is us." "Being stuck will be fun for some for a while, then it'll be a pain. That's a very small price to pay for, at last, the urgency of this starting to drive decision making."
<p>I do not see anything from Hosking, from then until recently, saying our lockdown was an overreaction.
<p>So it's easy <em>now</em> to look at results in Australia and say maybe what they did was enough. But who could be confident saying that three weeks ago? Not Mike Hosking apparently, and I think not anyone.
<p>Have some humility, Mike Hosking.
