<p>If the weather forecast isn't too horrible I'll be away the coming Sunday afternoon to Tuesday morning tramping in the Hunua hills southeast of Auckland.
<p>Thursday is Anzac Day, a public holiday, and I'll be taking Friday off to go on a holiday with my family. So I'll probably be in the office/online only on Wednesday next week (that's Tuesday for those of you on the wrong side of the date line).
<p>About a week later, Sunday May 5, I have a flight to San Francisco. I'll be in the Bay Area on Monday and Tuesday, and at LEAD training on Wednesday and Thursday.
<p>About week after that, Friday May 17, I'm flying to Taiwan for a Mozilla layout/graphics/media work week.
<p>Fun times!
