<p>I gave a talk about <a href="/assets/images/Rust-Debugging.pdf">"debugging techniques for Rust"</a> at tonight's Auckland Rust Meetup. There was many good questions and I had a good time. It wasn't recorded. Thanks to the organiser and sponsors!
<p>I'm also going to give a talk at the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/rust-akl/events/259480660/">next meetup</a> in June!
