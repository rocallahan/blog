<p>I agree with Labour leader Andrew Little <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11830481">on this</a>. Tourist numbers are growing, and making NZ a more expensive destination is a perfectly fair and rational alternative to fast-growing tourist numbers. NZ is never going to be a budget destination; better to be a high-price luxury destination with money reinvested to maintain and improve our facilities and environment, than a low-price destination with an environment degraded by too many tourists. I don't think we're anywhere close to being seen as a "rip-off".
<p>FWIW many backpackers I meet while tramping are here for months; for these people the impact of a border-crossing tax would amortized. Fewer people making longer trips is also more climate-friendly.
