<div class="columns">There's a lot of good food in Auckland but I find myself repeatedly drawn back to <em>Crazy Noodle</em> in Newmarket. It's relatively cheap, the ambience is pleasant, uncrowded and child-friendly, the food is wonderful, and there's great variety. The Hong Kong-style Western food isn't altogether to my taste, but it's fun to try. Their standard dishes such as beef chow fun and Singapore fried rice noodle are --- wonder of wonders --- not greasy. I believe their "vanilla sago milkshake" is the best milkshake I've ever had; it's difficult to have just one.<br/><br/>The place is also a brisk 30-minute walk from my house, which is nice on a pleasant evening when I have time to spare and no children.</div><br/><br/>
