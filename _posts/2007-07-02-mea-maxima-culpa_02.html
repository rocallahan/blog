<div class="columns"><p>People <a href="http://scobleizer.com/2007/06/27/firefox-on-macs-giving-people-fits/">have been complaining</a> about poor stability in the latest Firefox 2.0.0 Mac update.<br/><p>The good news is that I think Mats found the problem.<br/><p>The bad news is it seems to be entirely my fault.<br/><p>I guess it says a lot about how cool my job is that with a single mistake I can ruin the experience for millions of people.<br/><p>Looking at it that way, "sorry" doesn't really cut it. But ... sorry!</div><br/><br/>

<div class='content'>Given the number of issues we introduced in 1.8.0.12, I wonder whether we should in fact try to do one more Firefox 1.5 dot-release... or at least try to get people to update to 2.0 _very_ quickly.  :(<br></div>

<div class='content'>The major update to get people from 1.5.x to 2.0.x is already being pushed. I don&#39;t know what the uptake rate on that is.<br></div>
