Each year I find the first of April to be really unpleasant. For an information junkie like me, it's the one day a year when everyone conspires to pee in the water supply.<br/><br/>

<div class='content'>I like a well done April Fool&#39;s joke. The kind of thing that&#39;s snuck into a pile of legitimate news that you get to the end of before realising you&#39;ve been had.<br>Or the clever ones that are obviously a joke from the start, but which are very well constructed and detailed. The IP over Avian Carrier RFC, for example.<br>It&#39;s been a long time since I&#39;ve seen something like that on the internet however.<br>I have a feeling the internet is a 14 year old male with social issues.<br>- Colin<br></div>
