<p>It was pretty good. Lots of fun talking to people old and new. A few embarrassing incidents where I didn't recognize someone I should have. I brought down Settlers of Catan from my room --- Rob Arnold won, but only because Doug Sherk kept stealing my road. I also brought down Citadels and some other people played that. I should have brought more games! If we're still short of games tomorrow night we can call in reinforcements from the Toronto office.
