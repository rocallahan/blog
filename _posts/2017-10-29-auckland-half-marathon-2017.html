<p><a href="http://live2.tiktok.biz/results/view/aucklandmarathon/2017/08613">Not as good a time</a> as <a href="https://secure.tiktok.biz/results/view/aucklandmarathon/2016/11139">last year</a>, but OK. I seemed to run out of steam a bit towards the end this year; I'm not sure why. Maybe I pushed too hard too early, or just had a bad day. I should try running more fast 10Ks in the lead-up next year.
<p>I followed Alfredo's advice to reduce the wear on my bare feet by sticking some small pieces of climbing tape to the balls of my feet. It worked really well. The tape almost entirely wore off during the race, and my feet didn't feel any different while I was running, but the skin didn't wear away. In experiments on training runs I discovered that strips of tape parallel to the side of the foot work better than strips across the foot because in the latter case, the flexing of the foot seems to pull the tape off.
