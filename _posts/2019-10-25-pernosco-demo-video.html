<p>Over the last few years we have kept our work on the <a href="https://pernos.co">Pernosco</a> debugger mostly under wraps, but finally it's time to show the world what we've been working on! So, without further ado, here's an introductory demo video showing Pernosco debugging a real-life bug:

This demo is based on a great <a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2016-08-09/gdb-example-ncurses.html">gdb tutorial</a> created by Brendan Gregg. If you read his blog post, you'll get more background and be able to compare Pernosco to the gdb experience.
<p>Pernosco makes developers more productive by providing scalable <em>omniscient debugging</em> &mdash; accelerating existing debugging strategies and enabling entirely new strategies and features &mdash; and by integrating that experience into cloud-based workflows. The latter includes capturing test failures occurring in CI so developers can jump into a debugging session with one click on a URL, separating failure reproduction from debugging so QA staff can record test failures and send debugger URLs to developers, and letting developers collaborate on debugging sessions.
<p>Over the next few weeks we plan to say a lot more about Pernosco and how it benefits software developers, including a detailed breakdown of its approach and features. To see those updates, follow <a href="https://twitter.com/_pernosco_">@_pernosco_</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/rocallahan">me</a> on Twitter. We're opening up now because we feel ready to serve more customers and we're keen to talk to people who think they might benefit from Pernosco; if that's you, <a href="mailto:inquiries@pernos.co">get in touch</a>. (Full disclosure: Pernosco uses <a href="https://rr-project.org">rr</a> so for now we're limited x86-64 Linux, and statically compiled languages like C/C++/Rust.)
