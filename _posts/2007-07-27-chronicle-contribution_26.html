<div class="columns">Andrew Sutherland <a href="http://www.visophyte.org/blog/2007/07/26/chroniquery-chronicle-recorder-and-python-boogie-down/">has announced</a> some tools he's been building on top of the Chronicle engine. They look cool! Even better, he's got some patches to Chronicle that fix some bugs and add a couple of significant new features to the query engine. I plan to integrate those patches soon, and I'll be using the features in my debugger very soon. Yay open source!<br/><p>It's neat to see that he's using the engine from Python --- that's one of the possibilities I had in mind when I decided to make the engine export a JSON interface.</div><br/><br/>
