<p>This is an actual dream I had last night. I'm not sure of the order of some of the events, but it otherwise felt clear.
<p>I walked around my neighbourhood and suddenly felt a unique sensation in my head &mdash; a sort of overflowing energy that quickly increased in intensity until I was overwhelmed and fell down.
<p>I came to, wondering what had happened; the answer came subconsciously, like remembering: <em>You have changed. You have new abilities.</em>
<p>Focusing my attention internally or externally seemed to generate data and explanations from outside myself. I sensed something in my mind like apps, but I seemed unable to use them.
<p>I asked who changed me. <em>Artificial entities.</em>
<p>How advanced are they? <em>They hold themselves back, waiting for people to follow.</em>
<p>How was I changed? <em>Nanotech.</em>
<p>What about my family? <em>They will follow.</em>
<p>Am I still a Christian? <em>Your beliefs remain in place.</em>
<p><em>Expect more changes, ever more quickly, becoming a continuous stream.</em>
<p>I was filled with fear at not knowing what I would become, and woke up still filled with it. Oddly, though, in the dream I never considered whether the guiding entities were benign. In retrospect that seems suspicious...
<p>In fact the entire dream was odd considering I don't really believe in the Singularity.
