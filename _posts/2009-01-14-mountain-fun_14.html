<div class="columns"><p>Disappointingly there was no major eruption, so we're back! On Sunday we drove down to National Park, on Monday we did the <a href="http::www.tongarirocrossing.org.nz">Tongariro Crossing</a>, on Tuesday we went up Mt Ruapehu in the chairlifts and then drove back to Auckland, stopping at Huka Falls and the Craters of the Moon thermal area on the way.<br/><p>The Crossing is one of New Zealand's most famous walks, a 6-8 hour trek across Mt Tongariro, one of the active volcanoes of the North Island's central volcanic plateau. The weather was mixed --- it rained most of the second half of the walk --- but the trip was still spectacular. One particularly special feature was that early in the walk we had a very clear view all the way to Mt Taranaki.<br/><p>Below, left to right are Michael Ventnor, Chris Double, me, Brian Birtles, Matthew Gregan and Karl Tomlinson. (Chris Pearce had a pressing engagement in another country.) The photo was taken at Blue Lake, courtesy of Matthew Gregan (here's <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/28938245@N05/sets/72157612515638754/">his Flickr set</a>).</div><br/><div class="image"><img src="/assets/images/BlueLake.jpg" width="800" height="533"></div><br/><p>Emerald Lake in the rain, with steaming fumaroles on the slopes behind it:<br/><div class="image"><img src="/assets/images/EmeraldLake2.jpg" width="800" height="600"></div><br/><p>The Ketetahi Stream was in flood due to the rain; the water's gray color is due contamination by volcanic minerals by hot springs up the mountain.<br/><div class="image"><img alt="KetetahiStream.jpg" src="/assets/images/KetetahiStream.jpg" width="800" height="600"/></div><p>Intern at play on the upper slopes of Mt Ruapehu:<br/><div class="image"><img src="/assets/images/InternAtPlay.jpg" width="800" height="600"/></div><br/><p>Mt Ruapehu yesterday morning:<br/><div class="image"><img src="/assets/images/MtRuapehu.jpg" width="800" height="600"/></div><br/><br/>
