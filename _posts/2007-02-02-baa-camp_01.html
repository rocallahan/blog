<div class="columns"><p>This weekend is the "Baa Camp" (a.k.a. Kiwi Foo Camp) organized by O'Reilly via Nat Torkington. A number of interesting people are going, and I'm going too. I've had previous contact with several of the attendees: Asa Dotzler is going from Mozilla, Nigel Parker from Microsoft, David Cunliffe (NZ Minister of Information and Communication Technology, among other things), Ben Goodger, and Nat himself. I'm not sure what it'll be like. I have vague fears it will be a lot of hot air, but at the very least I ought to meet a lot of interesting people and have fun. (I used to be cripplingly shy in large groups, but over the years I've become a lot better at schmoozing. I think this is the most important thing I learned in grad school.)<br/><p>I really ought to demo some Gecko 1.9 features but unfortunately none of my builds are all that exciting right at this moment. Also, it rather steals your thunder when anyone can download a trunk Firefox build and see what's going on. Well, I'll do my best to wow the crowd one way or another.<br/><p>BTW lately I've been working on text, making progress towards getting our new textrun infrastructure working in Windows and Mac as well as Linux, and working on the new textframe code that sits above it. I've also been make progress on setting up the local Mozilla development office. That's something else I'll be able to talk about at Baa Camp.</div><br/><br/>

<div class='content'>So things have gone full circle :-) O&#39;Reilly sets up Foo Camp, non-attendees see the idea and set up a series of Bar Camps, and now O&#39;Reilly has (almost) reappropriated the name :-)<br></div>
