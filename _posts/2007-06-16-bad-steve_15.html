<div class="columns"><p>John Lilly has a great post about the <a href="http://john.jubjubs.net/2007/06/14/a-pictures-worth-100m-users/">scary Steve slides</a> from Apple's WWDC. Jobs' vision of the Web as a cozy duopoly is unsettling for all sorts of reasons, but it also makes little sense for Apple. Ongoing IE dominance would mean ongoing Web stagnation, and that would risk Apple losing platform control to Flash and Silverlight.<br/><p>It's also an interesting message to people outside Apple who are building on Webkit...<br/><p>Apple's Webkit developers have been good community citizens for a long time and I have tons of respect for them. I hope that continues, Steve Jobs notwithstanding. (Actually what I really hope is that those slides represent some marketing idiot's brain explosion and not Steve Jobs at all, in which case we can all calm down.)</div><br/><br/>
