<p>I'm leaving Mozilla. My last day will be this Friday, March 4 --- NZ time.
<p>This isn't the time to go into all the reasons why, but I will mention a couple of big ones. I've been working on the Web platform for sixteen years, full-time for eleven. It was necessary and I'm so proud of what we did, but it was never the most fun thing I could have been doing and I'm very tired of it. And now there's rr. People think it's amazing, and it is, but we're only scratching the surface of what could be done. I'm bursting with ideas, and realizing them will require a lot of resources, resources that Mozilla cannot and should not provide --- we probably need to capture some of the value of this technology via a for-profit company. We can change the way people debug software, and in its own way that may be as important as my Web platform work, and it's work I desperately want to do.
<p>I do not plan to disappear entirely from the Mozilla project. rr is the best research I've ever done partly because we've relentlessly focused on addressing real developer needs, so I want to stay engaged with Mozilla developers, helping them use rr and building tools for them that are a lot more awesome.
<p>This is hard. I love Mozilla and its people so much, and this is a bit of a step into the unknown. I'm been singing this a lot lately...<br>

<div class='content'>Roc - I have just started getting to know you. :|

I will greatly miss those insightful conversation at the workweeks and All Hands we shared. I will even miss the bowling. 

Good luck with rr. It deserves the focus. Please ping me at my mozilla address if you are interested in sharing thoughts/ideas as we continue the work on the Web version. 

p.s. the song is beautiful</div>

<div class='content'>I can&#39;t say I saw this coming but I did wonder if it was when I saw how big rr was becoming.  I&#39;m very happy for you and look forward to what you can accomplish working full time on this important new project.  I have faith that God will be with you in your new journey.

Echoing others, I want to thank you for all of the great work you have done for the web!</div>

<div class='content'>I&#39;m going to miss seeing you around a lot. Whether talking about Gecko or the gospel, it&#39;s been really fun. Thanks also for all your help personally and professionally.

I remember you said getting rr to work on Windows was an impossible task. Care to prove yourself wrong?</div>

<div class='content'>Dear Robert, I&#39;m sad to hear that you leave Mozilla. You had an absolutely massive influence on me when I was still a volunteer and when I started working at Mozilla.
You were one of the hero developers to me back in the time and that you wanted to meet me in person while you were at a conference in Amsterdam, meant a great deal to me.

I wish you all the best at your new job.</div>

<div class='content'>Looking back, I am glad I failed to recruit you around Y2K to Netscape/AOL when you got out of CMU.

I&#39;m also glad and proud that I pulled you out of Novell when you realized you were doing more Mozilla than Ximian work, and you were morosely telling me you might go to Google, and I said &quot;WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT LET&#39;S BUILD AN NZ OFFICE AROUND YOU AT MOZILLA&quot;, lol. Great team there, I hope you&#39;ll still get in there.

Looking forward to rr-the-startup!

<div class='content'>Sorry to see you go, roc. You are a great hacker, and a great man. God has blessed you greatly. Prayer meetings will be... smaller without you :-) 

Are you now going to reveal the secret of those long hex strings? Hashes of predictions? Did they come true?</div>

<div class='content'>I&#39;m sad to not have you around the Mozilla project, but I&#39;m heartened to learn that I don&#39;t have to stop my incessant whining about rr, nor do I lose my outlet for venting my vague and unrealistic ideas for future rr changes. I wish you all the best, in the original meaning of that phrase before it became a complete clich√©.</div>

<div class='content'>I had to tell myself: &quot;it&#39;s how it is, everybody has to move on eventually.&quot; I&#39;ve been associating your name with the Mozilla project for a very long time, and I got quite used to reading about whatever great advancements you came up with. Thank you very much for everything you&#39;ve done and good luck!</div>

<div class='content'>Are you saying you&#39;ll be working full-time on rr, somehow? Will we get an update about this soon? I love rr - when i saw the title of this post I thought it was the end, but it looks like it&#39;s not.</div>

<div class='content'>Yes. Yes. It&#39;s not the end for rr, more like a new beginning :-).</div>
