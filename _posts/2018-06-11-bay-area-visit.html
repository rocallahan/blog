<p>I'm on my way to San Francisco for a guest visit to the Mozilla All Hands ... thanks, Mozilla!
<p>After that, I'll be taking a break for a few days and going hiking with some friends. Then I'll spending a week or so visiting more people to talk about rr and Pernosco. Looking forward to all of it!
