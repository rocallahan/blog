<div class="columns"><p>Chris Double and I will be speaking at the next <a href="http://webdesign.meetup.com/108/calendar/8542022/">Auckland Web Meetup</a> on Thursday September 11 --- one week away. We'll be talking about Firefox 3.1 and the many new features and improvements it brings to Web developers.<br/><p>When I sent the blurb to John Ballinger a few weeks ago, I added "Plus Tracemonkey, the world's fastest JS engine." I'm glad that that's still true! (Yeah, I know Sunspider is just one benchmark, but still.) Now I hope it's still true next Thursday :-).<br/><p>Microsoft evangelists will be giving a presentation on IE8 at the same meeting. The whole meeting should be very interesting and a lot of fun --- especially for us, since I think that Firefox 3.1 has a strong story over IE8, especially for Web developers. I'm really looking forward to this.</div><br/><br/>

<div class='content'>You&#39;ll show demos, right?<br>Also, it would be nice to get a video of your presentation (in Theora of course :) ) or at least put on the web any slides or materials you&#39;re using.<br></div>
