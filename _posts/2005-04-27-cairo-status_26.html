<div class="columns">All my supporting patches have been checked into the trunk. It should be possible to build with cairo on Linux by running configure --enable-default-toolkit=cairo-gtk2 and get results similar to what I posted last week (better, actually, since I've fixed some image rendering bugs).</div><br/><br/>

<div class='content'>Hi Robert,<br>Can I ask what is causing these cairo builds to be so extremely slow compared to &quot;normal&quot; builds?<br></div>

<div class='content'>I don&#39;t know yet because I haven&#39;t run any profiles and I don&#39;t know the Cairo code.<br></div>

<div class='content'>Can you build it with --with-system-cairo or something similar?<br>Otherwise it&#39;s going to be hard to use a glitz enabled Cairo. :-)<br></div>

<div class='content'>Michel: not yet.<br>Ernst: Yes you can, but I don&#39;t recommend it because our Cairo has some patches that haven&#39;t made it to trunk Cairo yet, and it&#39;s not tested with any system Cairo. I&#39;m going to hack my build to use a hand-built Glitz to see how that goes. In the medium term we might have to pull Glitz into our tree.<br>Ludovic: We will set up non-GTK2 Cairo builds at some point in the future, but right now that is not a priority. If someone wants to hack on Cairo-Win32 then they can look at what we&#39;ve done for GTK2 and contribute a Windows configuration.<br></div>
