<div class="columns">After my weekly 5am teleconference, I decided to walk to the office via a long route --- from our house to the summit of Mount Eden, then down past my old high school, through the Domain, Auckland University and Albert Park to downtown. Apart from the exercise, I wanted to view Auckland from Mount Eden in dawn light. Indeed, it was spectacular. I wish I'd brought my camera, but in some ways I'm glad I didn't, because I'm not enough of photographer (nor is my camera enough of a camera) to do justice to the misty glow and purple shadows.<br/><br/>A bonus surprise was finding a film crew at the summit. The focus was on a woman wearing an astonishing costume of gilded Speedo plate mail which rattled as she walked. I would have guessed it was a <em>Xena</em> shoot if that  show was still in production, and if they hadn't been using the sunrise over Auckland as a backdrop. I can't imagine what it was about.<br/><br/>The rest of the walk was good too. I really like how the scattered joggers and walkers on Mount Eden smile and say good morning. Walking past Auckland Grammar School brings back lots of memories. In the Domain I took the Glade Path through a grove with tree ferns and waterfalls. Altogether it was  a lovely way to start the day.</div><br/><br/>

<div class='content'>If you go up there on 1st May, then the wacky Morris dancers are up there with all the new age people for dawn to dance in the summer. If they don&#39;t dance, then the sun doesn&#39;t come up. If they dance really hard then NZ skips the winter and can have a bountiful summer harvest. :)<br></div>
