<div class="columns"><p>Sometimes we take heat for deliberately not implementing certain Web platform features. Three significant examples are SVG Fonts, WebSQLDatabase and H.264 in &lt;video&gt;.<br/><p>SVG Fonts --- at least the subset implemented in Opera and Webkit --- don't offer anything significant over downloadable Opentype (or WOFF) fonts ... except the last three points of the Acid3 test :-(. And people keep asking for it "because it's in SVG 1.1". But I don't think those are good enough reasons on their own to make SVG Fonts an essential part of the Web platform.<br/><p>WebSQLDatabase has a completely different problem. It's the only way of doing structured, queryable client-side storage in any browser right now, and a lot of mobile apps targeting Webkit-based browsers use it. The problem with WebSQLDatabase is that it isn't good for the Web, because it depends completely to the semantics and query planning of SQL as implemented by SQLite --- which is a somewhat quirky SQL implementation.<br/><p>The pros and cons of H.264 have been well documented in this blog and elsewhere...<br/><p>SVG Fonts and WebSQLDatabase would actually be very easy for us to implement. SQLite is already embedded in Firefox and even exposed to non-Web Javascript. The SVG Fonts subset implemented by Opera and Webkit is very simple. We could even support H.264 by hooking into specific codecs that may be present on various platforms (I think; the licensing for platform codecs is rather vague). It's certainly tempting to just cave in, implement these features, and move on. The people who complain that we're lazy, stubborn, or just wrong would move on or find something else to complain about. If we were only interested in market share, that's definitely what we'd do. But I honestly think we're doing the Web a service by resisting these things.<br/><p>I think <em>not</em> implementing certain features is one of the hardest and most altruistic things we do.<br/><p><strong>Update</strong> I should also point out that we're not just exerting "stop energy" here; for each of these features that we're not adding, we are promoting superior alternatives --- namely WOFF, IndexedDB, and WebM.</div><br/><br/>

<div class='content'>I think the browser should integrate well with each platform it&#39;s on.  That goes for everything from file locations, to Look and Feel, notification API&#39;s, graphics API&#39;s abstracting hardware/software rendering, and yes, to support for platform codec API&#39;s too.<br>I&#39;m a huge FLOSS fan, and think building an enhanced WebM experience into the browser which isn&#39;t possible with the platform API is awesome, but I also think the platform API&#39;s should still be supported.  If every other media player on the system can support a codec (ie, Dirac) through the platform API, Firefox should too.<br>I would like to see Firefox not just support WebM internally, but install the codec onto the system, so that it becomes available to any media playing app on the platform (including IE, Totem, etc).<br>I would just rather see the WebM push be made through enabling, not disabling, user choice.  I&#39;m sorry if that makes me one of the &quot;complainers&quot; you wish would move on.<br></div>

<div class='content'>Although I understand Mozilla&#39;s contention that &quot;do what SQLite does&quot; is a poor standard, I must agree with all the existing criticisms of IndexedDB. Doing a join with IndexedDB is beyond ugly, and I contend that it&#39;s possible to create an efficient local storage mechanism that can be indexed and correlated without all the extra code that IndexedDB would require.<br>I just don&#39;t understand how the w3c could create a standard like IndexedDB and do such a poor job covering the use case of joining one &quot;object store&quot; to another based on correlating indexes. I like that IndexedDB works in plain javascript objects and allows me to store whatever properties I want into the object and retrieve them later; however, I absolutely need sane join support.<br></div>

<div class='content'>It&#39;s rather sad to see this. I was very happy to see mozilla&#39;s actions on H.264, and I don&#39;t know a lot about indexedDB but I&#39;m glad to see differing approaches being tried and thought through before standardization.<br>However SVG Fonts are a different story, they have been part of the published standard for ages; implementing them is not just about collecting ACID3 points.<br>SVG is the only thing out there as an open vector format. Just as it is beneficial to have PNG and JPEG supported for embedding in a web-page, so full support for SVG is of value. Imagine if mozilla only worked with some JPEG content and you had to load a JPEG into a processing application to check it used the bits of JPEG that mozilla liked before uploading it to an open web. Remember what MS&#39;s poor support for PNG&#39;s transparency did for web developers.  Why does it have to be this way for vector art?<br>I don&#39;t believe that WOFF is a replacement for SVG Font in SVG files (as in stand alone graphics). WOFF (even in data: URLs) is not part of the SVG standard and not supported by graphics apps, even if supported by browsers. SVG Font may be a limited format, but in many applications it is competing with reducing the text to svg:path, not with WOFF.<br>It is of benefit for the open web if text in header-type images (the sort that have traditionally been PNG), labels in graphs, or diagrams for embedding in a page, don&#39;t go to SVG paths, but to characters that can be selected by the user, or accessed by a screen-reader.<br>It would be great for content in open formats, for web developers, and for end-users who appreciate semantic, accessible content, if any complying SVG graphics could be viewed on the web. For that we need the whole standard supported.<br>I was under the clear impression from previous statements and bugzilla traffic, that it was mozilla&#39;s goal to support the whole of SVG -- it my have been taking a while, and not necessarily top priority (fair enough), but would be liked.<br>Please reconsider declaring any parts of SVG as &quot;bad for the web&quot;, unless there is a really good evidence that it is harmful, and that outweighs the benefits of supporting an open vector format, so that end users (not professional web devs) can use SVG images with confidence.<br></div>

<div class='content'>Té: I agree, and we do support all those CSS features with SVG.<br>Mary: SVG  is a good solution to that sort of problem. We support it.<br>Many other people: I carefully explained in comments above why *no browser* plans to implement every &quot;open standard&quot;, not even every W3C Recommendation --- nor should they. Some standards were junk from the start, others are obsolete and are being replaced by better alternatives, others are simply not good for the Web. I notice that no-one tried to respond to the points in those comments directly. Please do.<br>Inboulder: it&#39;s very hard to block a junk standard. If a subset of the paying members of the W3C decide they want a standard, they&#39;ll get it no matter who opposes. Even if the W3C worked differently, there are other standards groups --- e.g. ECMA and IETF.<br></div>

<div class='content'>Roc, how do you count the Web authors? You may not see much examples on the web for SVG Fonts, but why should Web developers make their SVG Fonts usage public, if the browsers with the most market share (mainly IE and Firefox) don&#39;t support it. But does it mean most Web authors are not interested in it?<br>Give them the freedom of choice and we will see if they will only use WOFF or if they also use SVG Fonts for special needs.<br>I also don&#39;t understand your comment, that standards don&#39;t need to get implemented just because they are standards.<br>Standards are the most important constant in the web out there. And Mozilla was one of the biggest advocate of web standards. Imagine a world wide web, without web standards, or in your case, where every browser supports other standards or doesn&#39;t support parts of it. The web wouldn&#39;t be what it is today.<br>SVG Fonts are part of SVG and are required in the SVG 1.1 specification. And I ask you and Gecko to support SVG Fonts as part of a web standard, like you and many other posters on Planet Mozilla requested Microsoft to support web standards (partly with success). I tried to explain this with my harsh comment &#39;Firefox gets next ie6?&#39; above.<br>Your argument that Mozilla supports many new features and works on a lot of new standards doesn&#39;t realy count. Microsoft also implemented new features like graphics filters for CSS, or SMIL support for HTML. They are no standards today, but the same may count to the new &#39;CSS features&#39; of today.<br>Why do you think users won&#39;t be interessted in SVG Fonts, what makes you think that they care about WOFF? I guess most useres are not interested in different font systems at all, but I don&#39;t know it. I think they are interessted in the result of using fonts and other techniques and of this is of course the task of the web authors. So tking care of the needs and wishes of users, is also taking care of the needs and wishes of web authors.<br></div>

<div class='content'>Havvy, fixating on &quot;altruistic&quot; probably isn&#39;t going to be helpful in generating dialogue, or in provoking responses accommodating your criticisms.<br>Would I be correct in guessing you&#39;re an Ayn Rand fan?  If you aren&#39;t, pick up Atlas Shrugged sometime, you&#39;ll like it.  If you are (I strongly suspect this to be the case), fine, suppose that nobody is ever altruistic and simply reinterpret the word as &quot;selfishly placing a high value on having a wide, indeterminate audience of others derive utility from one&#39;s actions&quot;.  (There might be a better rephrasing in explicitly selfish terms, but that&#39;s at least a plausible flavor.)  Put another way: I&#39;m happy because, through my actions, many many more people of all varieties are happy.  If you don&#39;t like the overtones of &quot;faux-compassion&quot; in a traditional definition, redefine and don&#39;t think about them.<br>For the decisions at issue here, I think Mozilla is certainly altruistic under that redefinition: most of all regarding putting one arbitrary variety of SQL dialect in the browser; next most regarding promoting video/audio formats presenting political headaches; and last for encouraging simple custom-font use with standalone font files (either TTF or easily-generated, easily-manipulated WOFF) rather than complicated, complex, ultimately unnecessary SVG fonts.<br></div>

<div class='content'>Not supporting these features and just providing alternatives means web developers will have to do things twice.

<div class='content'>Dirk, Microsoft never wrote a spec for their filters stuff, never submitted it for standardization, and never got (or looked for) support from other browser vendors. WOFF, IndexedDB and WebM all have support from multiple browser vendors and we&#39;re working towards standardization for all of them. So our behaviour is completely different from Microsoft&#39;s.<br>(AFAIK HTML+Time was actually a W3C standard, at least a draft. So I don&#39;t have a problem with that particular IE feature.)<br>&gt; I also don&#39;t understand your comment, that<br>&gt; standards don&#39;t need to get implemented just<br>&gt; because they are standards.<br>I don&#39;t understand why you don&#39;t understand. Maybe if I rephrase it again? How about this:<br>Some features in W3C Recommendations are not suitable for the Web and should not be supported in browsers.<br>I&#39;m 100% sure that core Webkit developers agree with that statement. For example, if you read public-html, you can see Maciej agrees that XSL-FO (a W3C Recommendation) is not suitable for the Web or Web browsers (we have CSS instead). We had the same agreement over XHTML2 before it was killed in the W3C.<br>WSDL, SOAP, WebCGM, XForms, XInclude, XQuery, and XSL-FO are just some of the W3C Recommendations that are not supported in browsers and should not be. Ask other Webkit developers, I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll agree.<br></div>

<div class='content'>This seems like a dangerously slippery slope. Mozilla has decided that they don&#39;t like part of a standard, so they&#39;re not going to support it. Is this Mozilla&#39;s policy, that they will support only the parts of web standards that they like? They&#39;re just going to arbitrarily pick and choose the parts of standards their browser will support? Is that really a wise path to follow?<br></div>

<div class='author'>Anonymous</div>
<div class='content'>Your reasons seem contradictory.  First, you argue against part of SVG 1.1 on the grounds that it&#39;s not a great feature (maybe so), even though it&#39;s in a specification which Mozilla otherwise implements.  That means that rather than writing to a specification, users have to write to the specific feature sets that are in the intersection of the feature sets of the browsers they care about.

Then you argue against WebSQL on the grounds that users would have to write to a specific feature set (a particular version of SQLite).  Whaaat?</div>

<div class='content'>I&#39;m a big WOFF fan but I think SVG fonts is both more and a lot less than fonts. Talking to the IE team, one main reason they have for not implementing SVG fonts is that it bypasses all the goodness they have in the Windows platform for displaying fonts but talking to the SVG guys there specifically, they brought up the idea that there&#39;s a much wider use case of defining a shape and re-using it that could be done at a higher level of abstraction in SVG 2, in a similar way to the thoughts around how filters could be dealt with at a higher level of abstraction. Is that an area you&#39;re looking at as a way of offering the things Web devs want to do with SVG fonts that aren&#39;t really fonts (logos, custom characters and the like)?<br></div>

<div class='content'>Neither Webkit nor Opera support colored or animated glyphs in SVG Fonts.<br>That&#39;s the point; they&#39;ve implemented the small subset of SVG Fonts that doesn&#39;t give you anything over TTF or WOFF.<br></div>
</div>
<div class='comment'>
<div class='author'>Robert</div>
<div class='content'>Grady, thanks for that detailed message.

WOFF does include the path data for each glyph of a font --- in Opentype format.

SVG Fonts can also be rendered differently on different clients, because SVG path rasterization is not standardized. I appreciate that in practice you&#39;d see less variation in SVG font rasterization than in Opentype rasterization.

We are working on an alternative approach to supporting SVG glyphs --- embedding SVG glyphs in Opentype Fonts, as suggested by Adam Twardoch and others --- that doesn&#39;t suffer from the deficiencies of SVG 1.1/1.2 Fonts and would hopefully have met your needs.

&gt; If you don&#39;t intend to support SVG 1.1 completely, then
&gt; remove SVG support entirely. Either support the entire
&gt; spec, or none of it. Half-Supporting a standard is
&gt; actually worse than not supporting it at all.

No browser supports full SVG 1.1 Fonts (e.g., no browser supports colored or animated glyphs), so do you conclude that all browsers should drop SVG support?</div>

<div class='content'>You must be learning what it&#39;s like to be a politician.

The trouble with being a politician is that you have to communicate the reasoning behind any controversial decisions to the satisfaction of the people. This is by definition difficult as the reason you were hired to make the decisions in the first place is because they weren&#39;t simple decisions and so are not simple to explain. If you aren&#39;t able to communicate effectively on particularly controversial decisions, well, we know what happens to those politicians/parties.<br>Good on you for communicating. I use SVG a lot, and although I wouldn&#39;t mind hearing an explanation of how WOFF can completely replace SVG fonts, I tend to trust your judgment.

Dear Mister O&#39;Callahan,

did you ever think about the fact that SVG might not only be used on web pages but also as a self contained interchange format for vector graphics? For such a format is supporting embedded fonts essentially so a single file can contain all of the graphics and doesn&#39;t need to be exchanged in company with a bunch of supporting files (the fonts).

The Mozilla Corporation is actively sabotaging this purpose of SVG by not implementing SVG-Fonts in its viewer applications (might it be the web browser or the Mailing client).

Please think about this issue one more time!

regards,

    Lars</div>

<div class='content'>smably and others: Adding every single &quot;standard&quot; to the browser is definitely not a wise path to follow. There are a number of standards that are pretty bad in various ways. And even non-objectionable standards add complexity to the Web platform and bloat to browsers, so have a cost for everyone. Thus the decision to implement a standard requires some cost-benefit analysis beyond just &quot;it&#39;s a standard!&quot;.<br></div>

<div class='author'>Grady</div>
<div class='content'>Robert your decision has hurt me as a developer. This is the first time that Firefox has ever let me down, and I hope it&#39;s not a sign of things to come. You seem pretty convinced there&#39;s no good need for SVG Fonts, so let me show you a valid real life example playing out right now.

I&#39;ll make this as brief as possible and break it down into points, since I&#39;m struggling to get under the character limit for this post.

-I&#39;m working on a commercial web application project, for a printing company with lots of different products.
-We decided to use SVG instead of Flash early on (big regret now).
-The application lets users create designs in the web application in browser, and send them for printing.
-Our outsourced printers accept vector artwork only.
-SVG seemed useful, because we could edit it with Javascript, and easily convert it to print ready PDF&#39;s.
-Naturally, SVG support is crap in IE9, and there&#39;s no support in IE8, and IE7.
-Our solution was to use SVG-Web for IE, and native SVG for other browsers.
-SVG-Web is it&#39;s own hell, that in many ways is different to native SVG.
-To develop one version of the application that uses SVG native and one version that uses SVG-Web, would cost development time (and hence money).
-Development time was justified by user statistics, 50% of visitors used something other than IE. There was to be two versions, SVG-Web (for IE), and native SVG for modern browsers.
-We discovered Firefox doesn&#39;t support SVG Fonts. Hence we would have to use SVG-Web for Firefox too.
-Firefox accounts for 25% of users here.
-75% of users would see the shim&#39;d version, and only 25% would see the native version.
-There&#39;s no justification for spending so much extra development time, on an alternative version for 25% of users, when the shim&#39;d version will work on their browsers as well.
-Hence, it was decided, no native version would be developed at all.
-No native version is being tested or developed. That means we must block users without flash support, since SVG-Web must run in Flash mode only.
-We must block users because we have no time to test or develop a native SVG version, or even see if our SVG-Web code runs properly in native SVG for some browsers.
-We must block users because we can&#39;t have something being printed that looks different to what they saw on screen. We need the print result to be reliably perfectly the same as the on screen design.

By now you may be wondering, &quot;What reason could you possibly have for needing SVG Fonts that badly, why couldn&#39;t WOFF font solve your issues?!&quot;.

-One of our major requirements which is not optional in the slightest, is that there can be no different between what the user sees on screen when designing, and what is printed.
-Standard method for ensuring print results are exactly the same as what&#39;s designed in a program like Illustrator, or in a webpage in our case, is to outline the text before it&#39;s sent.
-Text must also be outlined and turned into vector form for our printers.
-SVG Fonts include all the required information for us to outline text in the browser client side, ensuring what&#39;s sent is exactly what&#39;s on screen, with no difference.
-WOFF is useless to us because it can be rendered differently depending on the system it&#39;s on.
-WOFF also doesn&#39;t include the path data for each glyph of a font.

So there you have it. Hence we can&#39;t use WOFF, hence we need SVG Fonts, hence because Firefox doesn&#39;t support them, we are using SVG-Web for Firefox. Hence because we are using it for Firefox and IE, we&#39;re now using it for all browsers.

Here&#39;s my advice: If you don&#39;t intend to support SVG 1.1 completely, then remove SVG support entirely. Either support the entire spec, or none of it. Half-Supporting a standard is actually worse than not supporting it at all.</div>

<div class='content'>&gt; if Mozilla went totally pragmatic, focused on scrambling for market share, we&#39;d lose our reason to exist.<br>First, market share has always been an official top priority for Mozilla.

Thus, not implementing SVG Fonts hurts interoperability (and accessibility).<br>Third, Mozilla&#39;s reason to exist is to follow the standards.<br>So please, tell us again. Why would implementing SVG Fonts be bad for the web, again ?<br>If you really believe it hurts the web to implement a worse alternative for a feature, then remove CSS transforms from Gecko.

<div class='content'>I&#39;m not quite sure why IndexedDB is better than WebSQLDatabase.  I do agree that WebSQLDatabase is less than *ideal*, namely because as you mentioned it wholly abdicates specification of a SQL dialect to &quot;SQLite&quot;.  This abdication neither makes a good standard nor is good, SQLite is a quirky implementation of SQL which doesn&#39;t provide even a notable subset of any of the SQL standards.  But my qualm with IndexedDB as a &quot;superior alternative&quot; to WebSQLDatabase is that I don&#39;t believe anyone who is serious can honestly consider a hierarchical database a superior alternative to a relational database in such broad terms and keep a straight face.  Hierarchical are properly applied solutions to one subset of data-storage problems, and relational databases are properly applied solutions to a separate and mildly overlapping subset of data-storage problems.  If this were not the case, it&#39;s worth noting that we probably wouldn&#39;t have the substantial investment in relational databases that exists today — after all, hierarchical database models pre-date relational databases models by about a decade.<br></div>

<div class='content'>I was not talking about implementing all standards that the W3C provides, but I was talking about web standards. There are a lot of standards on the W3C that doesn&#39;t make any sense in the browser world and the intentions of them are to work on servers, SOAP is one of this examples. And partly XSLT as well, even if many browsers have support for it.<br>Mozilla decided to implement SVG, an undisputed web standard, but not a (currently requested) part of it. That&#39;s not the best decision in my eyes. Many comments above also gave some examples, why SVG Fonts still have it&#39;s relevance.<br>But I also have concern on feature proposals for SVG like 3D-transformations. It&#39;s not the task of SVG to support 3D effects. The first sentence of the SVG specification says: &#39;This specification defines the features and syntax for Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) Version 1.1, a modularized language for describing two-dimensional vector and mixed vector/raster graphics in XML.&#39;<br>2D, not 3D! But if 3D transformations will get a part of SVG, we&#39;ll add support for it as well.<br>That said, we continue to implement SVG Fonts 1.1 on WebKit, like we do for every other part of SVG.<br>I doubt that I will convince you of my beliefs here. I was very happy that Firefox get SVG animation support and I would be happy about SVG Fonts support too. I still hope, that Mozilla will reconsider the statement about SVG Fonts someday. :-)<br>PS: Thanks for the discussion and taking the time to declare your postion roc. It&#39;s not bad to have different positions on a topic, as long as it gets discussed, even if it just ends in an minimal consense like adding support for WOFF.<br></div>

And they are already rolling out square tons of svg with their inkscapes.<br>Unless mozilla convinces the inkscape team to roll out dummie proof svg+woff... that svg content will reach a critical mass.<br>These may not be &quot;good&quot; reasons, I know.<br>But if there&#39;s a need for good reasons to achieve success, there&#39;s no such requirement for failure.<br></div>

<div class='content'>Hi Robert, and thanks for your work at Mozilla.<br>It&#39;s my first comment her, but as I already reported on the corresponding bug (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=119490), I think you&#39;re wrong with SVG Fonts :<br>Let me explain why I<br>think SVG fonts are IMPORTANT for Firefox and for the web, and why it kill<br>kittens to postpone implementation.<br>If I had enough skill to do it, I suppose I already submitted a patch, but I&#39;m<br>not, so here I am, arguing.<br>I&#39;m a graphic and web designer, working with FOSS softwares, including<br>Inkscape. I learned more on how to use SVG with the &quot;Introduction to SVG&quot; W3C<br>Tech Course recently (I&#39;ve started to play with SMIL, and so on).<br>I come from a proprietary world were Flash is the easy and direct solution to<br>produce funny interactive medias in a few hours. Trying to produce half of the<br>same visual result with open standards is a pain for peoples who never learned<br>to code (yes, I try to, as much as I can, and I do not use Flash anymore).<br>Canvas, SVG, CSS, HTML5, WebGL are good steps for more interactivity and fun on<br>the web. But if actors as decisive as Mozilla do not implement them fully,<br>there is no hope on the horizon. Not to mention any authoring tool.<br>It&#39;s not about Acid3, even if it may be good for marketing purposes.<br>It&#39;s not about Opera, Chrome and Safari who have a minimal implementation of<br>SVG Fonts. It&#39;s not because they have one, it&#39;s because they have a poor one.<br>It&#39;s not about Opentype or @fontface which is better in some ways, and poorer<br>in others. It&#39;s another technology, for different purposes, in different<br>contexts. Yes it do part of the same thing, but you can&#39;t know in advance how<br>peoples will use it.<br>By not implementing SVG Fonts in a mainstream project like Firefox, tons of<br>smaller projects suffers : An example ?  Sozi : http://sozi.baierouge.fr/ and<br>Inkscape : http://inkscape.org/<br>Another ? The own Mozilla &quot;Game On&quot; : https://gaming.mozillalabs.com/<br>Yes, we can vectorize fonts, but you know it means killing semantic.<br>It&#39;s about hack-ability, openness, standards, and fun on the web. It&#39;s more<br>than really important.<br>A syllogism to make it definitely clear :<br>1) Typography is to design what the ball is to Tenis game.<br>2) The only serious candidate we have for interactive, animatable, colorful,<br>warpable, paterned, put-on-a-line, morphed open typography on the web is SVG<br>fonts.<br>Conclusion) There is no interactive, animatable, colorful, warpable, ... open<br>web-designs without SVG Fonts.<br></div>

<div class='content'>The alternatives you suggest may be superior but since Mozilla doesn&#39;t have the kind of mobile presence that Webkit has I just don&#39;t see those alternatives winning. In the meantime it just creates extra work for web devs trying to support different implementations of features. Firefox is a wonderful and amazing browser and I appreciate what Mozilla has done for the web by saving us from a web dominated by Microsoft but I fear that your principles are going to turn Firefox into the IE of the 2010&#39;s. What I mean is that implementing a feature for all of the other browsers will be easy but you will have to use a workaround for Firefox.<br></div>

A bunch of examples attempting to show its simplicity that could basically be done with JS array operations.

<div class='content'>I understand why you guys won&#39;t implement web storage and H.264, but I&#39;m really failing to see the reason for not supporting SVG fonts.<br>Generally, the best solution for a web designer is the simplest one. For example, border-radius in CSS3 makes more sense to use than hacking boxes of divs. You can do it both ways, but which is better?<br>The same applies to webfonts. WOFF is a great standard, I&#39;m sure. But if SVG fonts have specific advantages that aren&#39;t easily addressed using WOFF, and it&#39;s a set standard, what reason do you really have to give? Duplicating functionality is okay in such cases.<br>I don&#39;t care about browser market share. I care about common functionality. You have no excuse.<br></div>

<div class='content'>From http://slidedrive.wordpress.com/2012/05/11/svg-and-web-safe-fonts/
&quot;Things initially looked good: Marco Cecchetti programmed LibreOffice’s SVG exporting feature to embed copies of all necessary font/characters combinations in the exported document. It seemed like users would be able to use any fonts they wanted without needing to worry. Unfortunately, I soon realized that Firefox does not support embedded fonts in SVGs
...
So, here’s the approach I’m going with: include a list of alternatives for many common fonts. The top priority are fonts with identical metrics, as mentioned above, but at a lower priority we’ll include approximately-similar fonts, and finally fall back to a generic font category (serif, sans-serif or monospace). For each font in the document, try the following options in order:

    Check if the font is installed on the system.
    Check if the font is embedded in the SVG, if supported.
    Check if any of the fallback fonts are installed.
    Check if any of the fallback fonts are available through Google web fonts.
    Give up.

When the user is creating a presentation, they’ll be warned if they use a font that we don’t expect to be “safe”, and warned more strongly if they use a font we don’t recognize at all (i.e. have no fallbacks for, of any quality).&quot;</div>

A standard might start off with only good stuff, so you implement that, then it evolves and some strange or bad features are added.

<div class='content'>@ROC: &quot;If a standard has some good parts and some bad parts, doesn&#39;t it make sense to just implement the good parts?&quot;  Indeed, it does -- for the optional parts.  SVG Fonts are a required part of the standard, though.  &quot;Note also that *no browser* supports SVG 1.1 &#39;full&#39; Fonts, and none of them are working on such support.  Should all browsers drop SVG support?&quot;  Of course not, none of them support SVG in the first place! ;-)<br>IOW, feel free to support any SVG features you like, and leave out any you don&#39;t like.  Just don&#39;t claim support for the standard if you don&#39;t conform fully to the mandatory requirements.  If you advertise partial support, that&#39;s fine by me, and I probably won&#39;t even switch to a different browser to get support for SVG Fonts.  (By that I mean a statement like &quot;we support almost all features of the SVG 1.1 standard, but do not support SVG Fonts&quot;.)<br>I do think you&#39;re missing a bet here.  [X]Emacs supports creating &quot;private&quot; fonts (most simply via bitmaps), and this feature has been used in a number of useful applications.  In most cases they have since been replaced for almost all users by better technologies -- but I don&#39;t know of any cases where that took less than &quot;years&quot;, and in at least one case it took more than a decade.<br>I have to agree with those commenters who have said that defining fonts for SVG using SVG makes it easy to do, and easy to introspect when somebody defines a font that way.  I agree with you that authors are hardly representative of all users, but they are users, and they&#39;re pretty important ones.<br></div>

<div class='content'>SVG Fonts have one advantage over Opentype fonts: their hackability. SVG is writable for every interested web author whereas Opentype font generation is more of a specialized science with its own tools. I&#39;m frustrated, because I envisioned SVG Fonts as a great possibility to do image replacement (think logos and such) and glyph replacements (think ampersand, quotemarks).

<div class='content'>1) I&#39;m not interested in databases for browsers at this moment as this seems like its in the pre-alpha stage as far as standards go.  That being said, I have used MySQL and PHP on some projects and ASP.NET and MSSQL Server on other projects.  Based on the fact that most anyone doing anything with databases server side has used some form of SQL, my guess is that WebSQLDatabase will win based on familiarity.  Then again, the 50% solution that can be built out to 80% usually wins out over the &quot;right way&quot; in the tech field anyway.<br>2) H.264 vs WebM vs Theora will sort itself out with Apple (who has hitched its horse to the H.264 wagon) using H.264 exclusively, everyone else going with WebM as the second implementation, and Theora being used solely by Firefox, Chrome, and Opera. Yes, IE will still be the biggest, controlling share of the market and the market will accept IE&#39;s H.264/WebM set up as the de facto standard.  Also, I keep hoping that the TheorARM project helps Theora&#39;s chances.<br>3) ALL THAT BEING SAID...I still say Mozilla is being idiotic for not implementing SVG Fonts.  There is no excuse for this, as SVG Fonts are an OPEN standard and a SET-IN-STONE standard. As it was stated at Google I/O about Flash being implemented in Android 2.2 and roughly paraphrased here, &#39;an open web means an inclusive web&#39;.  In this case, you are excluding based on your personal tastes and wrapping yourself in the cloaks of benevolence and righteousness as you tell web designers like me that you know better what tools I want to use or need to use than I do.  Give me the tools and let me take them where I will.  And before you say that if I want a feature then I should submit a patch for it, I will state that I don&#39;t currently have the programming skills in this area to do something like implement SVG Fonts.  I rely on people with those skills at Microsoft, Opera, Mozilla, and in the Webkit/Google/Apple community to implement them for me so that I can use them.<br>That&#39;s my two bits on your post.<br></div>

<div class='content'>The TTX thing is pretty cool, but it&#39;s akin to using Latex 2 HTML rather than authoring natively in HTML.<br>Everything Mozilla does seems to be aimed at supporting openness and hackability: so we have the stand Moz took on video codecs, David Humphrey&#39;s work on exposing audio data to JS, supporting hackability with HTML and the DOM (over untamperable binaries), the crucial &#39;View Source&#39; command (which Moz supported when it was under threat years ago), supporting SVG as an image format with an object model, supporting canvas and the ability to manipulate pixel data, etc. WOFF just can&#39;t be as hackable as SVG fonts could be. WOFF doesn&#39;t have a DOM. I can&#39;t just inspect a WOFF font in Firebug, change a parameter, and see the effect. I can&#39;t view source a WOFF file on a whim and say &#39;Oh, that&#39;s an interesting approach; I might use that myself&#39;. This is not the overbloated MNG or SVG image format with the kitchen sink and network sockets. This is fonts --- glyphs --- scalable vector graphics (!) --- in a standardised scalable vector graphic format called SVG. It seems to me that not supporting SVG fonts goes against the very core philosophy of what Mozilla evangelises: openness, hackability and helping people beat that drum.<br>Now, if you&#39;re not implementing it because there&#39;s performance issues or because noone has time right now, I completely understand. Or maybe the SVG fonts spec isn&#39;t mature enough yet --- I&#39;d understand that too. But to take a stand *against* SVG fonts specifically from ever being implemented because they are Wrong . . .

<div class='content'>Whilst I agree with your stand over H.264 and WebSQLDatabase, I can&#39;t agree that WOFF is a suitable replacement for SVG Fonts.<br>For the simple situation of wanting to use an existing font for HTML content, WOFF is great. But SVG Fonts offer more than that: each glyph can be made up of arbitrary SVG content, making SVG Fonts an easy way to create &quot;libraries&quot; of content. Think circuit symbols or flowchart boxes.<br>The fact that such glyphs can be created using a developer&#39;s existing SVG knowledge (or current SVG authoring tools) puts SVG Fonts at an advantage for dynamic creation and manipulation within the browser. SVG Fonts can be created and manipulated using Javascript and the DOM, making them readily amenable to client-side creation and manipulation.

It might not be as good but it won&#39;t kill off WOFF and--for the effort it will take--it seems completely reasonable to implement it.  I&#39;d really like a better explanation in a post down the road for the decision.  I understand you don&#39;t think the standard is as good and I understand you don&#39;t want to just go with the crowd.

<div class='content'>Robert, I just wanted to let you know that there are some Firefox users, like me, that really get it and appreciate a lot the Mozilla stance on this.<br>Especially on H.264, a few months ago when lots of people asked to &quot;just use the native frameworks and codecs installed by users&quot;, I think video on the web was very close to become forever proprietary.<br>Only Mozilla saved the web on this and I&#39;m very grateful for it. I understand that you chose to withstand shitloads of FUD and unfair criticism to protect the web developers and the end users.<br>Thanks to Google now we have WebM and the danger of a proprietary technology like H.264 becoming essential for the web is even smaller (but the war is far from over).<br>Anyway, thanks.<br></div>

<div class='content'>That&#39;s not a good enough reason not to implement SVG Fonts. And that&#39;s the only one.<br>Since when does Firefox contain no duplicate features ?<br>There already are plenty of ways to achieve one given result. (i.e animations ? JS, SMIL, CSS-transitions, CSS-animations, Flash, GIF, APNG, video tag,... and it&#39;s not a problem for Mozilla to implement all of them)<br>So if it&#39;s easy for you, just implement SVG Fonts and move on, instead of spending time to write about it.<br>All this looks like an excuse to be late on Acid3 : &quot;Oh we could have done this for years! We just don&#39;t want to&quot;.<br>You either are wrong or don&#39;t want to tell what are the other reason.<br>A spec is a spec. And I don&#39;t want to switch from one spec to another while I&#39;m developing.<br></div>

<div class='content'>All those examples I mentioned are &quot;Web&quot; standards that could be implemented in browsers. Even today you can find people who want them in browsers.<br>We even had SOAP, WSDL and XForms support in Gecko some time ago. (We removed them.)<br>So, even if something is a W3C Recommendation, and you can implement it in a browser, and some people want it, that is not enough reason to make it part of the Web platform. I&#39;m sure my Webkit friends will back me on this.<br></div>

<div class='content'>voracity: sure: http://www.letterror.com/code/ttx/index.html<br>David: JS, SMIL, CSS Transitions, APNG and  all focus on different use cases so they&#39;re all worth having. I&#39;m not sure about CSS Animations yet. We have to support GIF and Flash because there&#39;s lots of content that uses them already.<br>&gt; And I don&#39;t want to switch from one spec to<br>&gt; another while I&#39;m developing.<br>Ultimately that means all the features of each spec get copied into all the other specs. That&#39;s not good for anyone.<br>MarkC: We have  for reusing symbols. Assigning symbols to characters and then rendering them using SVG Fonts would be an abuse of SVG Fonts IMHO --- it would muck up search and accessibility for example.<br>Dynamically creating WOFF fonts isn&#39;t easy, but all you need is a JS library that takes glyph data --- in some format like SVG fonts --- and produces a data: URL representing a WOFF font. A bunch of code, but probably not difficult to write and it only has to be written once. I don&#39;t expect client-side font creation to be really common.<br></div>

<div class='content'>As a long time SVG supporter, Not upholding the Spec was very disappointing.  As great as WOFF is, for web content, SVG is not exclusive to web-browsers. Due to this decision, the denial of any possible SVG Font patches, I&#39;ve now switched to Chrome.  I refuse to support a project, which purposely refuses adherence to such an incredibly important standard.  SVG is not an ill-conceived draft standard, recently cooked up by Google or Microsoft.  Your reasons are simply irrelevant,  and most importantly, not a reflection of this community.  Never would I have expected Firefox, to ever let me down to such a degree, as I previously held them in high regard.</div>

<div class='content'>I usually appreciate your insight. But frankly all your arguments in this issue disappoint me.<br>Their may be nice libraries around, but I have to review the code (in a language I may not know), review the license compatibility, and add the overhead to my application,...<br>Where do you see the simplicity, compared to common DOM manipulations ? Do I really have to clarify that.<br>Their are &quot;altruistic&quot; reason for not implementing H.264. But for svg fonts it&#39;s disdain towards existing svg implementations (and not only browsers), and authors.<br></div>

<div class='content'>Obviously the use of a WOFF font can not be compared with that of a SVG font for the simple reason that the WOFF font can not be part of the XML structure of the SVG.
Thus, the statements of Mr Robert O&#39;Callahan could be simply regarded as very stupid but I do not think this is the case. I rather think that Mr Robert O&#39;Callahan defends the interests of the company Adobe (Flash) against those of open source (SVG) in all understanding and dishonesty.</div>

<div class='content'>While I was thinking why do we disagree on fonts an analogy came to my mind - perhaps you are thinking that SVG fonts should be replaced by better technology of WOFF, similar to how GIF got replaced by PNG. But in my eyes, SVG fonts vs. WOFF are more akin to the situation of PNG vs. JPG - while JPG is used for majority of images there are cases where PNG is more useful.<br>SVG fonts fill different purpose as WOFF so it would make sense to support both.<br></div>

<div class='content'>I hope Firefox won&#39;t get the new IE 6. SVG Fonts will get an optional feature in SVG 2.0, so it is not a hard indication. And also H.264 is no  &#39;web standard&#39;. But a public announcement may not to support several web standards has a sneaky feeling.<br></div>

<div class='content'>Robert that&#39;s just your interpretation, all be it the dominant one amongst Mozilla circles it seems.<br>What cannot Mozilla be motivated purely by user satisfaction?<br>I think you&#39;ve hit the nail on the head. Mozilla thinks what you have said, that it is some sort of digital moral guardian of all that is good. However the world may be going virtual but superheroes are still fantasy.<br>It&#39;s a fallacy that without this moral purity Mozilla would have no reason to exist. That is merely the spin perpetuated by the people in charge. Here&#39;s a whole list of reasons for Mozilla to exist:<br>- Providing user choice (lest we suffer a Google/Microsoft duopoly or worse, Opera)<br>- Protect users (privacy, security)<br>- Innovate on behalf of users (AwesomeBar, labs)<br>- Empower users (extensions)<br>and yes ...<br>- influence standards<br>Notice the emphasis on users, not technocrats?<br>Broadly speaking Mozilla has done a great job for users but the idealism of the moral technocrats in charge needs to be constantly challenged by pragmatism. Not with an insatiable desire for market share but with an irrepressible focus on users because if there&#39;s one lesson to be learned from various battles in the browser &#39;wars&#39; to date, it&#39;s that - in the end - satisfying users is all that matters. Look at IE6. The bastard Microsloth child refuses to die at twice the age of Firefox 1 and still holds a similar share to Firefox overall. Why? Antitrust distribution was clearly not the only reason. IE6 provided developers of internal applications with the power to integrate the web into business systems with relative ease (and little security of course). Firefox essentially took back 25% of IE&#39;s ground because Microsloth fell asleep in the trenches and Mozilla produced a superior user experience.<br>As yet, Firefox has not won a battle in the browser war and needs to decide if it is going to fight one with Google or stay happy with - at best - one third of the market because the &#39;sloth has awoken and re-armed itself and there&#39;s a big new threat forging their attack well and truly above the horizon and over that big hill over there.<br>Is Mozilla happy to see a browser landscape where three players share around 30% of the market? If so it has very little to worry about I expect. If not, start focusing harder on satisfying users and less on puritanical technocratic morals.<br>Lastly here is a classic example of how puritanical techno ideology is actually a very poor tactic in the video codec scenario. Why?<br>### Mozilla already distributes H.264 in Firefox! ###<br>It is simply bundled inside a plugin: Flash.<br>By refusing to bundle H.264 for &lt;video&gt; you are in effect damaging web standards because users (content providers) will simply stick with Flash to present H.264 video ... and Mozilla will be encouraging this by bundling Flash.<br>Yes, that&#39;s right, unless VP8 kicks off (big question marks on the chances of that right now) Mozilla is effectively supporting proprietary code, not it&#39;s well-spun openweb.<br>You have to give developers a reason to use standards beyond that they are morally more pure. Even with VP8 developers are more likely to stick with H.264 because of it&#39;s superior toolchain and because it is supported across most browsers through Flash. Pragmatic developers will just keep using swfobject and &lt;video&gt; will become just another redundant tag.<br></div>

<div class='content'>IndexedDB is not a &#39;superior alternative.&#39; It&#39;s horrible for doing anything but the simplest queries. Maybe it&#39;s not a good idea to expose Sqlite in the browser, but don&#39;t pretend that IndexedDB is any better.<br>If SVG Fonts are easy to do, and they&#39;re required for Acid3 compliance, why not just do them? Other browsers are doing it and it&#39;s not slowing them down (they&#39;re all beating you in benchmarks) so the &#39;bloat&#39; will be invisible to the user if done right. The only reason users care about software bloat is because it complicates the software and it slows it down. This should do neither of those.<br>I&#39;m fine with you not supporting h264.<br></div>

<div class='content'>Chris: that approach would have seen us supporting ActiveX on Windows, which would have been disastrous for the Web and for FLOSS. See http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/roc/archives/2010/01/activex_all_ove.html for more.<br>pd and others: if Mozilla went totally pragmatic, focused on scrambling for market share, we&#39;d lose our reason to exist. We&#39;d just be another Opera or Google, except non-profit. The world doesn&#39;t need that.<br></div>

<div class='content'>Woah, hey there!  I take issue with that last comment implying that we Chromium folks are &quot;scrambling for market share&quot; over all else.  From where I sit what we, the team, care about is serving users and making the Web better -- the same sort of goals Mozilla has.  We simply come to different conclusions on some issues.  Reasonable people can disagree on some things.  Please don&#39;t demonize us, even obliquely.<br>FWIW, were we not burdened with having already released non-experimental SQL database support and thus being forced to support it, I suspect we&#39;d be happy to kill it.<br></div>

<div class='content'>If search and accessibility is a big concern, I would have thought that would be an argument in favour of supporting SVG Fonts.<br>I have an SVG-based webcomic, created entirely in Inkscape. In a yet-to-be-published strip, I had need of a specific font (it&#39;s a parody of a film poster) which I couldn&#39;t find. So I implemented the glyphs I needed as SVG paths, and constructed the text letter-by-letter, using Inkscape&#39;s &quot;clones&quot; (&lt;g&gt; and &lt;use&gt; in the XML I would guess) to ensure all instances of a glyph looked the same.<br>Although the result looks right, it&#39;s lost all sense of the text being text. It&#39;s not searchable or accessible at all (short of manually adding &lt;title&gt; or &lt;desc&gt; elements).<br>SVG authoring applications support SVG Fonts right now. I&#39;m not aware of any that support saving glyphs as WOFF data urls, or of any plans for such support in the near future. Data urls make the resultant SVG file opaque and harder to edit - the antithesis of the open web.<br>By all means advocate WOFF support. If it&#39;s genuinely better then it shouldn&#39;t be too hard to convince authoring applications to support it. But as SVG Fonts are supported by other browsers, have reasonably widespread authoring support, are a published part of the SVG1.1 spec, don&#39;t have the sort of philosophical/legal restrictions that accompany H.264 and would be easy to implement, then why not enable them _while_ trying to convert the world to WOFF?<br></div>

<div class='content'>Robert, thank you for this post - I don&#39;t think anybody could explain the issue clearer than you did. It&#39;s a problem most programmers have to deal with even though they rarely are as consequent about it as Mozilla. Unfortunately, people who don&#39;t want to understand the reasoning and simply beg for their pony will always object - see comments above. Hope those won&#39;t manage to discourage you.<br>Oh, and yes - SVG got out of hand trying to encompass everything. Agreeing on a sufficient minimal level of SVG support on the web is an important goal and will prevent future browsers from carrying around useless code only to provide a suboptimal solution for the problem.<br></div>

<div class='content'>Robert, am I correct in my understanding that other browser support for SVG Fonts is for the most part limited to what is needed for passing the Acid3 test?
