<p>On Saturday I participated in a protest march for the first time ever --- against the TPPA. I support lowering trade barriers, but the TPPA has a lot of baggage that I strongly dislike, such committing member nations to a dysfunctional United States-esque intellectual property regime, and sovereignty-eroding "investor-state dispute settlement". The biggest prize for New Zealand would have been free access to foreign dairy markets, but that was mostly not realized, so it seems like a bad deal for us.
<p>Unsurprisingly there were a lot of different sorts of people involved. Many of them espoused themes I don't agree with --- knee-jerk anti-Americanism, "Socialist Aotearoa", general opposition to free-market economics. That made it more fun and interesting :-). I think it's very important that people who disagree about a lot of things can still work together on issues they do agree about.

<div class='content'>This is a problem I always see with the protest community in NZ... they&#39;re terrible at staying on message, instead of taking the opportunity to push their own causes. So while most of the crowd was protesting TPPA, I also saw sizable minorities pushing the flag debate (both for and against), and a significant number of the general &quot;we hate John Key&quot; people.

I think protests like this would draw more support if they weren&#39;t constantly hijacked like that. It&#39;s hard enough to get people to participate anyway, and it&#39;s harder if they&#39;re marching surrounded by banners they bitterly disagree with.</div>

<div class='content'>Yes.

Also, it plays into the &quot;if you support free trade you must support TPPA&quot; narrative when everyone against the TPPA seems to be against free trade.</div>

<div class='content'>Exactly. You want *one* clear and simple message, representing the views of everyone present.

I take your point about the merits of working together with people you might otherwise disagree with - but promoting your own agenda at the expense of the group... that&#39;s not working together.

That said, this protest *was* better focused than many. The Occupy mob in Aotea Square a few years ago was hopeless in that respect - the banners then were a broad mix of anarchism, Maori independence, and cannabis legalisation. The core issue of inequality was completely drowned out...</div>
