<div class="columns"><br/>Things have been a bit stressful as the members of our family have taken turns hosting a virus and as we go through the processes of settling down. However, things are great. The weather has been fantastic --- especially by New York standards --- and it's incredible to be able to walk out the door, two blocks past sweet-smelling jacaranda trees and you're at the water's edge. Not to mention Erin Pt Park just a little further away, and downtown Auckland is sensational too, So much to talk about!<br/><br/>One odd thing I've just noticed is how deeply ingrained is my memory of New Zealand brands. At the supermarket I feel misty seeing the likes of Craig's strawberry jam, Tip Top ice cream, and even Diamond spaghetti. It's ridiculous --- and frightening --- just how much of my mental real estate they must have been squatting on all these years.<br/></div><br/><br/>
