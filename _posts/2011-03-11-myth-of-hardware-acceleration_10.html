<div class="columns"><p>A browser that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2011/03/08/comparing-hardware-accelerated-svg-across-browsers-with-santa-s-workshop.aspx">"fully hardware-accelerates the entire Web platform"</a> shouldn't have any trouble with a simple HTML scrolling testcase, should it? Try <a href="http://people.mozilla.org/~roc/scrolling-boxes.html">this testcase</a> in the browsers on your machine. Running fullscreen on my laptop, IE9 RC1 takes <b>more than ten times as long</b> as Firefox 4. That doesn't seem very accelerated to me. View the source to see that the testcase does nothing tricky.<br/><p>When we designed our <a href="/2010/07/retained_layers.html">"layers" framework</a> for GPU acceleration in Firefox, one of the goals was to accelerate scrolling, especially on pages where some parts of the page move as you scroll and other parts don't --- like that testcase. We have a component called FrameLayerBuilder that separates the moving parts from the stationary parts and assigns them to separate "layers". (The vicissitudes of CSS make this surprisingly difficult, but that's a topic for another blog post...) Each layer gets a VRAM buffer into which we draw the layer's contents; when we scroll, we only have to draw the content that has scrolled into view, and then we use the GPU to composite the layers together at their new positions.<br/><p>I can't say for sure what IE9 is doing in this case, but experimentation suggests that it simply repaints the entire page from scratch every time it scrolls the above testcase. This does not make best use of the hardware.<br/><p>I'm not here to bash IE9, just its marketing. Microsoft's message that IE9 is the apex of what a browser can do with the GPU is nonsense; in the above example, Firefox's rendering architecture makes better use of the GPU, by design. Microsoft's claim to hardware-accelerate "the entire Web platform" was always ridiculous because "the entire Web platform" contains features like HTML parsing, Javascript execution, and DOM manipulation which are simply not suitable to run on today's GPUs, and IE9 does not do so. (I'm assuming that Microsoft's "hardware acceleration" means "uses the GPU" ... if it actually means "uses hardware", that isn't saying much :-).) Microsoft's disdainful statement that "[other browsers are] choosing to accelerate only pieces of the Web platform" is hypocritical, because that's exactly what they do themselves.</div><br/><br/>

<div class='content'>How exactly does taking a few minutes to make a counter argument mean that Mozilla isn&#39;t focused on making Firefox better? That&#39;s making a pretty big logical leap.<br>In fact, roc&#39;s next post makes it pretty clear that Mozilla is working quite hard on analyzing their performance in the benchmarks specifically to do better. However, as they&#39;ve found, some of the benchmarks aren&#39;t what they claim to be and I think Mozilla has every right to say that!<br></div>

<div class='content'>op:sorry to have to correct you but did you try hard to test ie9!i ll give you a hint!activate compatibility in ie9 and retest,since ie9 hasnt changed since it was lunched it is no cheat,according to my informal test minefield did your test in 5000(+- 700)ie9 did it in 1500((+-700)so as you can see ie 9 wasnt an issue,true if you disable compatibility thing look different but it is hardly slow it is just that some stuff used in that test is either not recognised by ie9 or is very old software.wouldnt have posted but my friend told me it needed to be posted so you would need these info for accurate comparision</div>

<div class='content'>@RyanVM<br>&gt; So if that roc&#39;s demo had some fancy design you would believe that IE9 is worse?<br>I&#39;m not talking about a fancy design, I&#39;m talking about games like http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/Performance/Helicopter/Default.xhtml or http://www.pirateslovedaisies.com/ and any other demo that goes further than just scrolling thousands of circles<br>&gt; Do you know that IE9 cheats on SunSpider benchmark?<br>Oh please, don&#39;t go that way. What IE9 does is a very common practice on any compiler.

<div class='content'>Not too realistic a test for average website performance; I don&#39;t think it&#39;s common for websites to have 10 thousands elements on a single page.<br>But, it seems a reasonable test of a browser&#39;s rendering architecture efficiency.<br>My system:<br>Intel Core 2 Duo w/integrated gfx (NVIDIA 9300)<br>Ubuntu 10.10 64bit w/NVIDIA 64-bit linux driver<br>Yes, FF4 hw acceleration does work with this config; WebGL works as well.<br>And because it matters, the size of the viewports I tested were roughly 1152x720.<br>(rounded averages from several runs)<br>FF 4.0rc : 2s<br>FF 3.6.15 : 1.3s<br>Chrome 11.0.686.3 : 3.4s<br>Opera 11.01 : 25.8s<br>Look at FF3.6! Unfortunately, the FF3.6 test is skewed because the border-radius and box-shadow CSS properties didn&#39;t have the -moz prefix and so were ignored; web pages can render a lot faster when not applying rounded borders and shadows to over a hundred on-screen elements.<br></div>

<div class='content'>OK, so Firefox 4 excels at some things and IE9 at others - neither has a perfect rendering engine.  IE9 gets the same or better score on your own HW stress test. http://www.conceivablytech.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/stress.jpg  Scrolling is just one area where IE9 is lacking - thanks for pointing that out.  Can&#39;t the browsers just live in peace and harmony?<br></div>

<div class='author'>Robert O'Callahan</div>
<div class='content'>As others have noted, the FF3.6 results are meaningless because the unprefixed border-radius and box-shadow are not supported, and they&#39;re key to this test. The same may be true for Safari 5 but I can&#39;t check right now --- look closely at the page for shadows and rounded corners.<br>I didn&#39;t add prefixed border-radius or box-shadow because you just know someone is going to see &quot;-moz&quot; in the test and conclude that it&#39;s rigged somehow.<br>A large window size does show the performance differences more clearly. My windows were fullscreen on a 1920x1080 screen, minus the Windows 7 taskbar on the left and each browsers&#39; chrome at the top.<br>Of course IE9 is using acceleration on my system :-).<br></div>
