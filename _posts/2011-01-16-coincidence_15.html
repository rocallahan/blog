<div class="columns"><p>Tonight at a BBQ with church friends and family one of my kids was singing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Purple_People_Eater">The Purple People Eater</a> song. Later my wife and I (re)watched <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raiders_of_the_Lost_Ark">Raiders Of The Lost Ark</a>. While checking some details on Wikipedia later I discovered that the movie uses a famous stock sound effect, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_scream">"Wilhelm scream"</a>. That scream which was performed by actor/singer Sheb Wooley, who originally composed and sang "The Purple People Eater". Wow!</div><br/><br/>
