<div class="columns"><p>Next week is <a href="http://www.lca2010.org.nz/">linux.conf.au</a> in Wellington. I'm going to be there from Wednesday to Friday, and I'll be giving a talk about <a href="http://www.lca2010.org.nz/programme/schedule/view_talk/50168?day=friday">why open video is important for free software</a>. Actually I think I'll make it more interesting by broadening it with some discussion of the relationship between Web standards and free software in general.<br/><p>On the way down to Wellington, a group of Mozilla-related people are going to be stopping at National Park Sunday night and Monday night so we can attempt the <a href="http://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/tracks-and-walks/tongariro-taupo/ruapehu-area/mt-ruapehu-crater-climb/">Mt Ruapehu summit walk</a>. Should be fun, if the weather cooperates.<br/><p>Anyway, this means I'll be completely offline Monday/Tuesday and mostly offline Wednesday to Friday next week.</div><br/><br/>
