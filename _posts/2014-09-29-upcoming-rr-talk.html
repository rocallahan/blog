<p>Currently I'm in the middle of a 3-week visit to North America. Last week I was at a Mozilla graphics-team work week in Toronto. This week I'm mostly on vacation, but I'm scheduled to give <a href="https://calendar.csail.mit.edu/events/141068">a talk</a> at MIT this Thursday about rr. This is a talk about the design of rr and how it compares to other approaches. I'll make the content of that talk available on the Web in some form as well. Next week I'm also mostly on vacation but will be in Mountain View for a couple of days for a planning meeting. Fun times!
