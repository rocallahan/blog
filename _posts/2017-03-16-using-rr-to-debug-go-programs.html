<p>rr seems to work well with Go programs, modulo some limitations of using gdb with Go.
<p>The DWARF debuginfo produced by the standard Go compiler is unsatisfactory, because it does not include <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/18247">local variables held in registers</a>. Instead, build with <a href="https://golang.org/doc/install/gccgo">gccgo</a>.
<p>Some Go configurations generate statically linked executables. These work under rr, but they're slow to record and replay because our syscall-interception library is not loaded. When using rr with Go, be sure to generate dynamically linked executables.
<p>Running Go tests using <tt>go test</tt> by default builds your project and then runs the tests. Recording the build step is wasteful, especially when the compiler is statically linked (see above). So build the test executable using <tt>go test -compiler gccgo -c</tt> and then run the test executable directly under rr.
