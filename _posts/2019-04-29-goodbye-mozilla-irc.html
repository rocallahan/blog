<p>I've been connected to Mozilla IRC for about 20 years. When I first started hanging out on Mozilla IRC I was a grad student at CMU. It's how I got to know a lot of Mozilla people. I was never an IRC op or power user, but when #mozilla was getting overwhelmed with browser user chat I was the one who created #developers. RIP.
<p>I'll be sad to see it go, but I understand the decision. Technologies have best-before dates. I hope that Mozilla chooses a replacement that sucks less. I hope they don't choose Slack. Slack deliberately <a href="https://twitter.com/SlackHQ/status/958645632620748800">treats non-Chrome browsers as second-class</a> &mdash; in particular, Slack Calls don't work in Firefox. That's obviously a problem for Mozilla users, and it would send a bad message if Mozilla says that sort of attitude is fine with them.
<p>I look forward to finding out what the new venue is. I hope it will be friendly to non-Mozilla-staff and the community can move over more or less intact.
