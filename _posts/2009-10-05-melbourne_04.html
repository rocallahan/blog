<div class="columns"><p>We had a great time visiting relatives in Melbourne. During the week we took a three-day road trip along the Great Ocean Road southwest to the Twelve Apostles rock formations, then north to Hall's Gap in the Grampian mountains before returning to Melbourne. We did a lot of short walks --- at Anglesea, Marriner's Lookout, Maits Rest, the Cape Otway lighthouse, the Gibson Steps, the Loch Ard gorge, Chautauqua Peak, and McKenzie Falls. Along the way we saw wild koalas, kangaroos and wallabies. The Great Ocean Road reminded me of Big Sur. The stories of shipwrecks, settlers, hardship and survival were inspiring. A great trip.<br/><p>One tip: a brochure claimed the return trip to the base of McKenzie Falls takes one hour and twenty minutes, so I almost skipped it, but we did it in twenty-five minutes, with two five-year-old kids. It's well worth it!</div><br/><div class="image"><img alt="Ducklings at Anglesea" src="/assets/images/AngleseaDucklings.jpg" width="800" height="600" title="Ducklings by the river at Anglesea"/></div><br/><br><br/><div class="image"><img alt="South coast of Australia near the Gibson Steps" src="/assets/images/Gibson.jpg" width="800" height="600" title="The south coast of Australia looking west from above the Gibson Steps"/></div><br/><br><br/><div class="image"><img alt="Loch Ard Gorge" src="/assets/images/LochArdGorge.jpg" width="800" height="600" title="Loch Ard Gorge"/></div><br/><br><br/><div class="image"><img alt="Chautauqua Peak, looking south" src="/assets/images/Chautauqua.jpg" width="800" height="600" title="Looking south from Chautauqua Peak"/></div><br/><br/>
