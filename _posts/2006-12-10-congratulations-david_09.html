<div class="columns">... on landing the reflow branch. This is a great day.<br/><p>Now we finally pass acid2, we've improved performance, and fixed a lot of bugs. Yay!<br/><p>Also, we can now make major reflow changes again without fear of making David's life miserable with difficult merges to the reflow branch.<br/><p><strong>Update</strong> Just to clarify --- the reflow branch landed after we branched for 1.9 alpha 1 (this was intentional!), so 1.9 alpha 1 does <strong>not</strong> have the reflow branch and does not pass acid2. You'll have to get a nightly build or wait for 1.9 alpha 2 to come out.<br/></div><br/><br/>
