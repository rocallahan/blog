<div class="columns"><p>I'm very grateful to have received an award for "Open Source Contributor" in last night's <a href="http://computerworld.co.nz/news.nsf/devt/D8348EE39BC433C2CC2574CE00820FFD">New Zealand Open Source Awards</a>.<br/><p>This kind of event --- with a fairly heavy business and government presence --- was rather foreign to me, but nevertheless the evening was a lot of fun.<br/><p>In accepting, I mentioned that I'm already well rewarded for my open source contributions, and thanked all the people who labour away tirelessly on useful projects without much reward or recognition.</div><br/><br/>
