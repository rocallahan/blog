<p>We're heading into autumn here, but whatever.
<p>I've taken advantage of my change in focus to have a massive clean-up of my data. A whole lot of email and files related to Web stuff I just deleted. After that, it was pretty easy to completely clear my inbox. The hardest part was that to honestly clear it I had to <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rr/commit/6db59da5e08951e567d046c11b165d159a43f45f">fix</a> a gnarly rr bug breaking Samba tests. For the first time ever, maybe, I went through all my email filters and unsubscribed from almost every email list I was filtering, and removed the filters.
<p>I bought a Yubikey and transferred all my TOTP-using accounts to it. That makes me feel more secure than keeping them on a smartphone. Speaking of which, I need to buy a new Android phone to replace this Nexus S so I can actually get security updates.
<p>I renamed my blog. "Well, I'm Back" might have been confusing for people.

<div class='content'>Inbox Zero doesn&#39;t require you to _do_ everything in your inbox. &quot;Defer&quot; is also an option. But well done for fixing the bug anyway :-)</div>

<div class='content'>I got a couple Yubikeys recently (one for backup if the primary is lost) with the thought of setting them up with things, but it hasn&#39;t been quite as pleasant as hoped.

Google seems to require you have specifically a phone to set up 2FA initially (even if you want to use Yubikey exclusively after that), and it doesn&#39;t appear a phone <em>number</em> (that can receive calls but not texts) suffices.  Meanwhile, Github&#39;s support (if using a Yubikey) requires more than entering a Yubikey OTP in a text field, namely FIDO U2F browser APIs, and so doesn&#39;t work with Firefox <em>at all</em>.  (Talk about browser lock-in!)

MIT&#39;s system, at least, was the straightforward fill-in-a-text-field process.  But they (and Mozilla&#39;s 2FA before it) are thus far the only 2FA systems I&#39;ve used with Yubikey that worked without complications for me.</div>

<div class='content'>Oh, and it looks like Google does the Github-style thing with Chrome lock-in, if I read the description of the process correctly.  Shocker!</div>
