<div class='content'>Doesn&#39;t it bother you that you never disclosed any of these ?
Don&#39;t you think it kind of prove how bad your predictions are... ;-P

Seriously, if any of those predictions turned out to be wrong, please disclose them. I&#39;m sure they are very interesting, anyway.

What if something happen to you by the time they must be revealed?
I sincerely hope nothing bad happen to you, though !!</div>
