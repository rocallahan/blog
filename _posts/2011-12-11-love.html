<p>Our family went to "Christmas In The Park" tonight at the Auckland Domain. Overall it was pretty fun but the choices of songs to cover were not entirely to my taste. There were too many insipid pop songs about "love", a genre I detest. Who writes this stuff? I appreciate the need to sell music to teenagers, who may think "love" is a fleeting obsession with another person, but celebrating that is just dumb. What is that compared to real, long-lasting love, that is based on self-sacrifice, not just in moments but over the long haul? Down with angsty superficial "love" songs!

<div class='content'>Do you have favorite &quot;love&quot; songs to recommend, or are there unwritten ones in your head you would like to share with us? If you have some lyrics you would like to set to music, I would be interested in collaborating.</div>

<div class='content'>@Franklin Chen: If you understand French, look into the works of George Brassens. There are several about love, and love of the long-lasting category, not just &quot;love at first sight&quot; (which in French is not called love but wfw &quot;a stroke of lightning&quot;).</div>

<div class='content'>I agree, there are too many songs about love, whether the real kind or the teen kind. There is so much more of the human experience that I&#39;d like to see captured by songs.</div>

<div class='content'>I agree with you Robert but today I was reminded of this great love song:

The love of God is greater far
Than tongue or pen can ever tell;
It goes beyond the highest star,
And reaches to the lowest hell;
The guilty pair, bowed down with care,
God gave His Son to win;
His erring child He reconciled,
And pardoned from his sin.

Oh, love of God, how rich and pure!
How measureless and strong!
It shall forevermore endure—
The saints’ and angels’ song.

When hoary time shall pass away,
And earthly thrones and kingdoms fall,
When men who here refuse to pray,
On rocks and hills and mountains call,
God’s love so sure, shall still endure,
All measureless and strong;
Redeeming grace to Adam’s race—
The saints’ and angels’ song.

Could we with ink the ocean fill,
And were the skies of parchment made,
Were every stalk on earth a quill,
And every man a scribe by trade;
To write the love of God above
Would drain the ocean dry;
Nor could the scroll contain the whole,
Though stretched from sky to sky.</div>

<div class='content'>Franklin: I don&#39;t have anything particular in mind. I&#39;m terrible at music.

Of course a lot of Christian music covers sacrificial love, which is good, but not person-to-person so much so there&#39;s still a gap there.</div>

<div class='content'>If you find it annoying, just substitute the word &quot;beer&quot; for the L-word (when used as a noun).

Then you can re-discover some of the great classics such as the Beatles&#39; &quot;All you need is beer&quot;; Elvis &quot;can&#39;t help falling in beer with you&quot;..

There are many many more. My personal favourite (so far) is Spinal Tap: &quot;Lick my beer pump&quot;.</div>

<div class='content'>Honestly, beer can be used as a verb too. &quot;Beer me tender, beer me true...&quot;</div>

<div class='content'>I agree that lust, infatuation, and angst are overrepresented in popular music. The range of emotions associated with love, not to mention human experience in general, is so much broader. &quot;Title of the Song&quot; by Da Vinci&#39;s Notebook makes fun of the trend.

Here are some songs exploring other aspects of love.

<strong>Sacrifice for love</strong>: Tish Hinojosa&#39;s &quot;Donde Voy&quot;. The narrator is an undocumented immigrant, trying to provide for her family back home, and misses them greatly.

<strong>Love for children and grandchildren</strong>: Plumb&#39;s &quot;In My Arms&quot;, Lene Marlin&#39;s &quot;The Way We Are&quot;, and Vienna Teng&#39;s &quot;Anna Rose&quot;.

<strong>Love as an inspiration for self improvement</strong>: Hoobastank&#39;s &quot;The Reason&quot;.

<strong>Conflicts between lovers</strong>: Delta Goodrem&#39;s &quot;Electric Storm&quot;, Eminem and Rihanna in &quot;Love the Way You Lie&quot;.

<strong>Love transcending conflict</strong>: Carrie Underwood&#39;s &quot;So Small&quot;. This song has a great music video, by the way.

<strong>Songs about improving the world, for the love of humanity</strong>: &quot;Through Your Hands&quot; (I like the version by Joan Baez), Kathy Mar&#39;s &quot;Acts of Creation&quot;, and Jackson Browne&#39;s &quot;The Next Voice You Hear&quot;.</div>
