<div class="columns">We're going to be shipping SVG support in Firefox 1.5. Opera is already shipping some SVG support in Opera 8. It would be very helpful to know how well these two SVG implementations interoperate. We already know they cover slightly different subsets of SVG 1.1 but for the set of SVG features they both claim to implement, it would be very useful to see if there are many bugs that occur in one browser but not in the other --- it would give us, at least, a chance to fix some of those bugs on our side so authors targeting multiple browsers get better results.<br/><br/>Any volunteers? There are a number of SVG tests out there on the Web. This work should be relatively easy to do. Even just doing a few tests would be helpful. The more that gets tested, the better.</div><br/><br/>

<div class='content'>The CVS HEAD of the Safari WebKit also has some preliminary SVG support. It might be a good idea to include that in comparisons as well :)<br></div>

<div class='content'>They don&#39;t say what the &quot;serious security issues&quot; are, so who can say anything about it? I believe the latest Firefox (1.0.6) is secure against all publically disclosed vulnerabilities.<br></div>

<div class='content'>Well, I find 1.0.6 version secure and stable.<br></div>
