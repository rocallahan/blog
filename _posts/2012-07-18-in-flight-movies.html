<p>Picoreviews (including last month's trip to Beijing)
<ul>
<li><em>Wrath Of The Titans</em>: Blah.
<li><em>Puss In Boots</em>: Surprisingly good. Better characters, plot and action than your average action movie.
<li><em>The Great Magician</em>: Good. Mixed tone, but interesting and fun.
<li><em>Chronicle</em>: Good.
<li><em>John Carter</em>: Blah.
<li><em>Contagion</em>: OK. Not best watched on a plane next to someone coughing.
<li><em>The Invention Of Hugo Cabret</em>: OK. A bit too much "look, a movie about movies, isn't this clever".
<li><em>Mission Impossible 4</em>: OK. Utterly generic but well done at that.
<li><em>Salmon Fishing In The Yemen</em>: Technically proficient, but it focuses on a protagonist whose marriage isn't very good so he runs off with a younger woman. I don't find that heroic, so I don't sympathize with the narrative thrust and the movie simply does not appeal.
</ul>
<p>Recently in theatres I've seen <em>The Avengers</em> (really good), <em>Prometheus</em> (good in every way except that it makes absolutely no sense --- what a missed opportunity), and <em>The Amazing Spiderman</em> (good in every way except that it's a retread of a ten-year-old movie that was perfectly good the first time around).

<div class='content'>I thought Chronicle was predictable, but pretty entertaining anyway.</div>

<div class='content'>Robert, I hope you took advantage of the in-flight time to watch these Hollywood movies in Chinese, rather than English... much more enjoyable that way.... ;)
