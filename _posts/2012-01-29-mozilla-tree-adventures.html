<p>Last week we had a few overseas Mozillians stop by the office on their way back from <a href="http://linux.conf.au/">linux.conf.au</a>. We took the opportunity to hold our annual Mozilla Auckland outdoors event, which for only the second time ever did not involve volcanoes. Instead we went to <a href="http://treeadventures.co.nz/">Tree Adventures</a> out in Woodhill Forest. Basically you strap on safety gear, climb ladders into the trees (up to 14 metres above the ground) and conquer a variety of obstacle courses on wires from tree to tree. Flying foxes are also involved. It's tons of fun, unless you have a fear of heights as I do, in which case it's tons of fun mixed with just as much sheer terror. I was glad to be able to overcome my instincts and keep going; that sort of mental discipline is worth practising. I just hope none of my colleagues noticed me whimpering.
<p>We followed up with a nice lunch at <a href="http://www.hallertau.co.nz/">Hallertau</a>.

<div class='content'>Rob,

Great photo! Do you have one including the ground?

If I hadn&#39;t seen the photo, I would have geeked out and wondered about what&#39;s going on with the ASTs in my favorite browser.

By the way, I have nominated you for a Liebster Blog Award: http://franklinchen.com/blog/2012/01/29/liebster-blog-award-5-blogs-you-should-check-out/</div>
