<div class='content'>Hah, that&#39;s funny. Never happened to me tho; I usually have more of a problem with Google maps when there are stores missing on there and I have to drive too far :(<br></div>

<div class='content'>Wow...I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever had anything quite like that happen before, but...<br>...that&#39;s why you call ahead.  I know, in this day and age, everyone just assumes &quot;I read it on the Internet, so it must be true.&quot;  Still, sometimes store hours change and aren&#39;t posted online, or product inventories are incorrect - it pays to let your fingers do the walking.<br></div>
