<p>I only just now found out about the <a href="http://www.eventcinemas.co.nz/media/272103/RetroShowcaseA4.pdf">"Retro Showcase"</a> going on in Auckland!
<p>Fortunately it will still be going on when I get back. In order of priority, I would like to see
<ul>
<li><em>It Happened One Night</em>
<li><em>Gone With The Wind</em>
<li><em>The Apartment</em>
<li><em>Black Narcissus</em>
</ul>
<p>Of those, I've only seen <em>Gone With The Wind</em>. Many of the others are good films that I've seen but don't need to rewatch.

<div class='content'>It&#39;s usually possible to see a lot of retro movie in Paris&#39;s theater, but you probably have better things to do. The recent renovation of Orsay has given a great result, if you go there don&#39;t forget Orsay whilst smaller than the Louvres is still one of largest museums of the world and needs a complete day to visit fully.</div>
