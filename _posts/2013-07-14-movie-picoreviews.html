<p>I've just returned home from another Bay Area trip for the LEAD program. I also met up with Dirk Schultze and some other Adobe developers for some work on SVG/CSS filters.
<p>Because of the Asiana crash at SFO, my flight to SF was delayed by ten hours and became a daylight flight, so I watched five movies on the way there. I watched two on the way back. The movie haul this month was pretty good actually.
<ul>
<li><em>Life Of Pi</em>: Brilliantly executed but not all that interesting.
<li><em>Seven Psychopaths</em>: Slightly above average. A lot more interesting than the title would suggest.
<li><em>Stoker</em>: Above average thriller.
<li><em>Argo</em>: Pretty good, apart from the gratuitous slander against New Zealand.
<li><em>Trance</em>: Somewhat absurd but interesting thriller.
<li><em>Side Effects</em>: Pretty good mystery/thriller.
<li><em>Dangerous Liasons (2012 Chinese version)</em>: Pretty good, but I'm a sucker for Chinese period drama, not to mention Zhang Ziyi and Cecilia Cheung.
</ul>

<div class='content'>It&#39;s maybe a nice movie for people who have been there. Otherwise itâ€™s not so exciting, since you don&#39;t divine what the story is about from the movie itself.</div>
