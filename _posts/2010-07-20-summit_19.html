<div class="columns"><p>I'd better say something about the Mozilla summit at Whistler before it recedes into the past...<br/><p>It was fabulous, of course. The setting, the food, the people, the talks, the work, the demos, the mission, all really good.<br/><p>Whistler was lovely. It had been cold up to the week we arrived so while it was 30C in the village at times later in the week, 20 minutes in a chairlift brought you up into the snow. And on top of Whistler Mountain the snow banks were six metres deep in places.<br/><p>I wisely arrived a couple of days early and on the Monday I spent almost the entire day hiking alone up to Singing Pass. Unfortunately I didn't reach Singing Pass --- around the snow line the track was completely blocked by fallen trees (see below). I climbed over a couple of dozen of them but with no end in sight, decided that was a losing proposition and turned back. Nevertheless it was a wonderful time and some solitude was excellent fortification for the subsequent social overload.<br/><p>I'm not really a party person and working large groups of people is a learned skill for me. It's helpful when I have goals to accomplish and I know a lot of the people. In some ways it wasn't all that different from networking at an academic conference, except we're all on the same side.<br/><p>The main downside of the summit was that I was completely exhausted during most of it because I was simply too excited to sleep. Talking to people, going to sessions, playing games, and hacking code are irresistible.<br/><p>Next time we should plan some "work week" days immediately after the summit. This would give us more time to talk in depth --- there were so many people at the summit I wanted to talk to, I couldn't give lots of time to more than a few. It would give us more time to code. We should have done it this time but I wasn't on the ball.<br/><p>As usual I met many contributors for the first time. That's one of the best things about the summits. A few I really wanted to meet didn't make it --- you know who you are!<br/><p>I managed to get together with some Mozilla Christians for some prayer time. That was very encouraging.<br/><p>I saw bears. Woohoo!</div><br/><div class="image"><img alt="trees fallen across the path up to Singing Pass" src="/assets/images/FallenTrees.jpg" width="800" height="600"/></div><br/><div>This is the track near the head of the valley leading up to Singing Pass. I'm looking <em>back</em> along the track at the trees I've already clambered over! Definitely more trees than track at this point. People told me it was probably the leftovers of an avalanche.</div><br/><div class="image"><img alt="view over Whistler valley" src="/assets/images/WhistlerValley.jpg" width="800" height="600"/></div><br/><div>View over Whistler valley from the top of Whistler Peak.</div><br/><br/>

I probably would have shown up had I known it was happening (although I was so zonked out from lack of sleep I&#39;m not sure how lucid I could have been).<br></div>
