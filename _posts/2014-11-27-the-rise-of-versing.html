<p>My children frequently use the word "verse" as a verb --- not in the technically correct sense of "to compose verses", but as a transitive verb form of the preposition "versus". For example they might say "I'll verse you at Monopoly." For a long time I'd never heard this usage other than from my children (though I assume they picked it up at school), but recently I saw it in a New Zealand online forum. I wonder if this originated locally and whether it will stick. I think it's actually a useful word; the closest equivalent I can think of is "play", but in my mind "I'll play you at Monopoly" doesn't carry the same emphasis on competition.

<div class='content'>Yep, my kids too (ages 9-11).  Would be interested to know if it&#39;s just a NZ thing, or wider - anyone?</div>

<div class='content'>&quot;contest&quot; is probably the closest I can think of that has the desired meaning, but I have a hard time seeing someone say &quot;I&#39;ll contest you at Monopoly&quot;....</div>

<div class='content'>This isn&#39;t just the regular verbing though.

1. Typical verbing involves changing nouns into verbs. This is a preposition. I can&#39;t think of any other examples of this happening.
2. The word has changed from &quot;versus&quot; to &quot;verse&quot;, probably to maintain a clearer distinction between the verb form and the preposition (because both are followed by nouns/noun phrases).

I think &quot;challenge&quot; is a pretty close equivalent, but &quot;challenge&quot; is probably an old/boring person word.</div>

<div class='content'>Challenge is close, but it means &quot;invite someone to engage in a contest&quot; whereas &quot;versing&quot; seems to mean &quot;actually participate in a contest&quot;.

Perhaps &quot;versus&quot; changed to &quot;verse&quot; because &quot;versused&quot;, &quot;versusing&quot;, &quot;versuses&quot; etc are too clumsy.</div>

In French, I&#39;d say &quot;affronter&quot; or &quot;se mesurer Ã &quot;

<div class='content'>Interesting!  We said something like this in the US when I was pretty young, 7-11 or so.  I don&#39;t recall if it was &quot;verse&quot; or more like &quot;versus&quot;.

I distinctly remember hearing it around video games especially.  This may be just a little too neat and tidy post-hoc reasoning, but we played a lot of Street Fighter back then, and a prominent screen had two characters with &quot;VS&quot; or &quot;VERSUS&quot; in between them, don&#39;t recall which.  Maybe at that age we didn&#39;t know what &quot;versus&quot; meant and derived a verb from somewhere?

I definitely don&#39;t remember anyone using that past middle school (&gt;13 or so).</div>
