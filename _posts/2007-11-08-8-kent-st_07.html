<div class="columns"><p>As I mentioned recently, our team is growing to six people over the summer, so we need new space. After trials and tribulations reported previously on this blog, we finally have a lease on new office space at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&time=&date=&ttype=&q=8+Kent+St,+Newmarket,+Auckland+1023,+New+Zealand&sll=-36.847385,174.765735&sspn=0.048698,0.069437&ie=UTF8&ll=-36.86788,174.775894&spn=0.012171,0.017359&t=h&z=16&iwloc=addr&om=1">8 Kent St, Newmarket</a>.<br/><p>This is a pretty cool area. There are lots of great food options in Newmarket. On the very block of the office there's O'Callahan family favourite <em>Crazy Noodle Bar</em> plus two yum cha (dim sum) restaurants (<em>Sunnytown</em> and <em>Sun World</em>) and a Mongolian BBQ place <em>Gengy's</em>. Nearby there's <em>Happy Valley</em>, <em>Hansan</em>, <em>T-Mark</em>, three food courts, a Chinese bakery, and lots of other places I don't know well ... yet. The office is actually above <em>Lone Star</em>, a big American-style place.<br/><p>Given that, it's fortunate that I'll be able to walk to and from work. It's about 30 minutes each way at a fast pace. For people who live further away, there are great bus and train connections.<br/><p>I'll be able to go for a walk in the Domain when I need to get away from my computer and actually think.<br/><p>The <a href="http://www.rialto.co.nz/vistait/village/default.aspx">Rialto</a> movie theatre is about a block away from the office. Maybe interns will have enough time to use it.<br/><p>My old high school, Auckland Grammar, is only about a kilometer away. It feels like after 20 years I haven't come all that far :-).</div><br/><br/>

<div class='content'>That sounds fantastic.  I have a 30 minute work to work and I can recommend it.  :-)  If you drive to work currently, you might recognise the stress of it by its absence when you walk.<br>The choice of eateries sounds mouthwateringly broad.<br></div>

<div class='content'>Is there a way to look up Auckland public transport online? It seems pretty far away from where I&#39;ll be staying...<br></div>

<div class='content'>Michael: it&#39;s not. It&#39;s maybe a 30 minute walk from where you&#39;re staying, less if you walk fast. There are also lots of buses. See maxx.co.nz. We move in on December 3 so for the first week we&#39;ll be at the current Cook St location. There&#39;ll be time for you to figure everything out :-).<br></div>
