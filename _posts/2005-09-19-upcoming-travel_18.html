<div class="columns">On Monday I'm leaving for a two-week work trip. In the first week I'll be in England, specifically Cambridge, for the program committee meeting for the ACM Principles of Programming Languages conference to be held in January 2006. I've spent the last few weeks mostly reviewing papers in preparation for this meeting, where we will select the papers to be presented at the conference. It's been a lot of fun catching up with what's going on in the world of PL research --- and a lot of work, especially because I did some extra background reading to catch up on what's happened in the last several months. I'm looking forward to the PC meeting since I've never done a face-to-face PC meeting before.<br/><br/>After Cambridge I'm heading to Oxford on Friday the 23rd to catch up with a friend and give a talk about Firefox development.<br/><br/>Then I'm off to Mountain View for some face time with other Mozilla developers at the Foundation headquarters. I'm also planning to visit the Google campus on Tuesday the 27th. On Wednesday I'll zoom up to Berkeley to give a talk there about Firefox development and catch up with some friends. I head off back to NZ on Friday night. Along the way I'm hoping to meet up with a bunch of my old friends living in the south Bay. I'm really glad to have chances to travel and sort-of-keep-in-touch with so many people. It's also fun to be on my own without the kids, up to a point; my three-week trip in May was too long, but hopefully two weeks will be about right.<br/><br/>Just a few hours after I get back to Auckland I'll be whisking off again, to Queenstown for a few days with my family. Great! I'll be back at work on Thursday October 6.</div><br/><br/>

<div class='content'>I saw your thumbnail renderer for geco. I was wondering how much you would charge to make a program that would batch compress thumbnails from a list of webpages, one text input one page per line, output jpeg compressed thumbnails named the page name with replaced characters www.ww.com/page.html as www.ww.com.page.html.jpg<br>just a thought of mine if you could send me a quote for this if you have the time.<br>Thanks,<br>Jay Pound<br>webmaster (at) poundwebhosting.com<br></div>
