<p>Some places I like these days that are (mostly) pretty close to my house:
<ul>
<li><strong>Jade Town</strong> (Dominion Road): Uighur food. A bit Chinese, a bit Indian, but not much like either.
<li><strong>Cypress</strong> (Dominion Road): New-ish yum cha (dim sum) place. Some interesting dishes I'd never seen before.
<li><strong>Viet Kitchen</strong> (Dominion Road): More authentic, bit more expensive Vietnamese.
<li><strong>Hot And Spicy Pot</strong> (Dominion Road, city): tasty pay-per-weight stir-fry.
<li><strong>Barilla</strong> (Dominion Road): Decent cheap dumplings and other Chinese food.
<li><strong>Tombo</strong> (Newmarket): Quality Korean-Japanese BBQ/hotpot buffet.
<li><strong>Hansan</strong> (Newmarket, city): Still a favourite cheap Vietnamese-Chinese place.
<li><strong>Master Dumpling</strong> (Newmarket): good dumplings, great sweet potato in melted sugar.
<li><strong>Faro</strong> (Newmarket): Nice Korean lunch combo.
<li><strong>Momotea</strong> (Newmarket): Taiwanese-style cafe with strong frozen drink selection.
<li><strong>Selera</strong> (Newmarket): Malaysian cafe food.
<li><strong>Sun World</strong> (Newmarket): Reliably good yum cha.
<li><strong>Kimchi Project</strong> (city): Kimchi fusion-eseque place. Kimchi carbonara is great.
<li><strong>BBQ Duck Cafe</strong> (city): Good value tasty Hong Kong-style cafe.
<li><strong>Nol Bu Ne</strong> (city): Great value Korean food.
<li><strong>Uncle Man's</strong> (city): Malaysian food &mdash; best roti around IMHO.
<li><strong>Kiin</strong> (Mt Eden): Great cheap Thai food.
<li><strong>Altar</strong> (Mt Eden): Good value sandwhich+fries lunch special.
<li><strong>Corner Burger</strong> (Mt Eden): Great burger+fries+shake combo &mdash; the shakes are especially good.
<li><strong>Gangnam Style</strong> (Takapuna): Korean BBQ buffet. The worst thing about this place is the name.
<li><strong>Petra Schwarma</strong> (Kingsland): Really nice Jordanian food.
<li><strong>Mama Rich</strong> (Greenlane): Good Malaysian cafe food, a bit cheaper than Selera.
<li><strong>Chocolate Boutique</strong> (Parnell): Not exactly a restaurant but for dessert, a great option.
