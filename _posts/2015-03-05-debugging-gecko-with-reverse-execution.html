<p>Over the last month or so I've added reverse-execution support to <a href="http://rr-project.org">rr</a>'s gdb interface. This enables gdb commands such as <tt>reverse-continue</tt>, <tt>reverse-next</tt>, <tt>reverse-finish</tt> and <tt>reverse-step</tt>. These work with breakpoints and watchpoints, so you can do things like
<pre>
Breakpoint 1, nsCanvasFrame::BuildDisplayList (this=0x2aaadd7dbeb0, aBuilder=0x7fffffffaaa0, aDirtyRect=..., aLists=...)
    at /home/roc/mozilla-inbound/layout/generic/nsCanvasFrame.cpp:460
460   if (GetPrevInFlow()) {
(gdb) watch -l mRect.width
Hardware watchpoint 2: -location mRect.width
(gdb) reverse-cont
Continuing.
Hardware watchpoint 2: -location mRect.width

Old value = 12000
New value = 11220
0x00002aaab100c0fd in nsIFrame::SetRect (this=0x2aaadd7dbeb0, aRect=...)
    at /home/roc/mozilla-inbound/layout/base/../generic/nsIFrame.h:718
718       mRect = aRect;
</pre>
(Here the "New value" is actually the value before this statement was executed, since we just executed backwards past it.)
<p>Since debugging is about tracing effects to causes, and effects happen after their causes, reverse execution is a big deal. I've just started using it to debug Gecko, and I'm enjoying it immensely! I find myself having to unlearn a lot of my usual debugging tactics; much of what I've learned about debugging up until now is really just workarounds for not having had reverse execution.
<p>An example from today: working on bug 1082249, I was in a function <tt>nsDisplayTableItem::ComputeInvalidationRegion</tt> with a <tt>geometry</tt> variable pointing to an <tt>nsDisplayBackgroundGeometry</tt> when it should have been a <tt>nsDisplayTableItemGeometry</tt>. At first I considered various indirect ways to figure out where the <tt>nsDisplayBackgroundGeometry</tt> came from, but now there's an easy direct way: set a breakpoint on the <tt>nsDisplayBackgroundGeometry</tt>, make it conditional on <tt>this ==</tt> the current value of <tt>geometry</tt>, and reverse-continue to see exactly where that specific object was created (in a subclass of <tt>nsDisplayTableItem</tt> that I hadn't thought of).
<p>This work is checked into <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rr">rr master</a>. It's not well tested yet, so a new official rr release is not imminent, but I'd appreciate people trying it out and reporting issues. At least I have been able to use it to get work done today :-).
