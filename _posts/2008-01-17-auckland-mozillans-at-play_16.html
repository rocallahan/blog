<div class="columns"><p>Today the Auckland Mozilla team did a kayaking trip down the Puhoi River. We had tasty lunch at the "Art Of Cheese" cafe and then paddled rented kayaks first upstream a bit and then down to Wenderholm on the coast. The weather was superb --- warm and sunny. The Puhoi valley is very peaceful. We've had very little rain in the last month so the grass wasn't as iridescently green as usual, but it's still a beautiful area.</div><br/><div class="image"><img alt="River Valley" src="/assets/images/RiverValley.jpg" width="800" height="600"/></div><br/><p><br/><div class="image"><img alt="Team"<br/>src="/assets/images/FiveOnRiver.jpg" width="800" height="600"/></div><br/><br/>

<div class='content'>Wow!  I think the Auckland office gets the &quot;most awesome&quot; for being close to beautiful natural places.  Tokyo is fun, but it&#39;s an urban jungle here.<br></div>
