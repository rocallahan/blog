<div class="columns">Someone on IRC asked about the pohutukawas flowering. The pohutukawa is a native tree that produces beautiful red flowers in December --- very apt for Christmas. The Internet has thousands of photos of flowering pohutukawas; here's mine.<br/><p><strong>Update</strong> I forgot to mention --- this photo was taken in Shakespear Regional Park, yesterday (i.e. Saturday). We drove up with some friends, had a picnic, and did the Tiri Tiri Track loop in about two hours. It was magnificent.</div><br/><div class="image"><img alt="Pohutukawa" src="/assets/images/Pohutukawa.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></div><br/><br/>

<div class='content'>They also produce copious amounts of a very irritant pollen, a kind of poor man&#39;s itching powder, which led me to nickname them &quot;Pollutokawa&quot; as a teenager.<br></div>
