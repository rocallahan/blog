<p>To address <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rr/issues/1490">issue 1490</a>, I just <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rr/commit/ef4c2f05ff71437d6af4d106801d6a4c31eff289">checked in</a> an rr improvement that changes the behavior of gdb+rr in a user-visible way. When the last thread of the debuggee process exits, rr generates a fake SIGKILL signal before exiting the process. This gives the user a chance to reverse-execute from the end of the debuggee execution, when previously rr would have let the process terminate normally so reverse execution cannot occur. The new behavior is a little bit of a lie since in most cases SIGKILL was never actually sent, but I hope the usefulness of this new behavior outweights any possible confusion.

<div class='content'>Man, that would have been so useful in the various occasions where I had to debug a program that prematurely exited. That being said, considering reverse-execution is supported by gdb itself, I wonder if gdb shouldn&#39;t be the one doing it, possibly optionally.</div>
