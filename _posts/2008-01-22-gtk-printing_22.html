<div class="columns"><p>Michael Ventnor has integrated the GTK print dialog and spooling infrastructure into Gecko; for details and screenshots see his <a href="http://ventnorsblog.blogspot.com/2008/01/print-me-print-me-print-me-man-after.html">blog post</a>. This is a big improvement in printing for Linux users for Firefox 3.<br/><p>I'm very pleased because it's one of the features Nat wanted me to do while I was at Novell that I didn't get to.<br/><p>I made Michael go through many iterations of code review and improvement, but it's probably not perfect yet, so test it and file bugs!</div><br/><br/>
