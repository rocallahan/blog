<div class="columns"><p>Fairly standard Microsoft press conference contains <a href=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=5&objectid=10454247&pnum=0">one very odd quote from Ray Ozzie</a>:<br/><blockquote>Chief Software Architect Ray Ozzie, who spearheads Microsoft's push into Web services, argued that leading-edge technologies began with consumers. Microsoft's access to consumers gave it a leg up over rivals focused on serving corporations and large organisations, he said.</blockquote><br/><p>Who are Microsoft's key rivals? Apple, Google, maybe Yahoo, maybe Adobe, maybe even Mozilla ... all far more end-user focused and less enterprise-oriented than Microsoft. So what is Ozzie talking about? IBM? Surely that's not who Microsoft fear.<br/><p>I found this comment particularly ironic since Microsoft tends to favour the interests of enterprise customers over other users, e.g. in the timing of IE updates.</div><br/><br/>

<div class='content'>Hello, I just was browsing your article found here:<br>http://www.idealliance.org/proceedings/xtech05/papers/03-04-03/<br>Well, the svg example doesn&#39;t work when I copy it into a new document and then load it with Firefox.  Can you advice on how I might go about accomplishing the goal of including svg into an xhtml document in the manner you demonstrate?  Thank you.<br></div>

<div class='content'>Perhaps he was comparing to Oracle and their ilk?<br></div>
