<div class="columns">Good news! <a href="http://www.oopsla.org/2005/ShowPage.do?id=Home">OOPSLA 2005</a> has accepted our paper on <a href="http://http.cs.berkeley.edu/~sfg/partiqle-0411.pdf">Light-Weight Instrumentation From Relational Queries Over Program Traces</a> by <a href="http://http.cs.berkeley.edu/~sfg/">Simon Goldsmith</a>, <a href="http://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/">Alex Aiken</a> and me. This is work I did with Simon in the (northern) summer of 2003 while he was an intern at IBM.<br/><br/>I'm glad to see this work get published; I think it's an exciting new area of research. The idea is to express dynamic program analyses (e.g., "how many times does function A get called during an invocation of function B") as SQL-like queries over a database containing a full trace of the program execution --- but instead of actually building such a database, our compiler translates the relational query into instrumentation code that gets injected into the program to evaluate the query on the fly as the program runs.</div><br/><br/>

<div class='content'>Sweet, congrats!  I&#39;ll congratulate Simon in person :).  Actually, I got a paper in too, so hopefully I&#39;ll see you there.<br></div>
