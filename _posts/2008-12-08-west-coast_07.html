<div class="columns"><p>After getting back from Waiheke we picked up Jonathan Kew and dragged him out west to the Piha area. I can't let people visit Auckland and miss out on the spectacular wild west coast. We strolled around on the beach, which was predictably crowded by NZ standards, being the first really warm Saturday of the summer. But we also did the Mercer Bay loop, a favourite 1-hour walk of mine along the clifftops just south of Piha --- no-one else in sight. You just have to be careful taking photos, since last year (or so) someone ill-advisedly stepped outside the fence and fell off the cliff.</div><br/><div class="image"><img alt="View over the ocean from the Mercer Bay track" title="View over the ocean from the Mercer Bay track" src="/assets/images/PihaOcean.jpg" width="800" height="600"/></div><br/><br/>
