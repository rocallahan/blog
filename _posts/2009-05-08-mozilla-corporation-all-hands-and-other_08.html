<div class="columns"><p>The MoCo All-Hands was tons of fun. I'm a bit annoyed that bits of our project planning ended up <a href="http://tech.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=09/05/07/2048204">on Slashdot</a> within a few days --- the perils of being open! Why doesn't this happen to other projects? Anyway, I felt the time was quite productive beyond just feeding Slashdot. With a couple of exceptions, meetings were goal-oriented and we were able to reach decisions. Of course it was also great to meet a number of new MoCo developers and other staff.<br/><p>I also took the chance to meet up with friends, as I often do. So many of my friends have gravitated to the Bay Area, I can only visit a subset of them on every trip, which is a bit awkward! Still it's great that I get to seem them.<br/><p>I drove up to Berkeley a couple of times. On Saturday I met up with my friend and we visited the Asian Art Museum in San Francisco, but spent most of the time sitting in the museum cafe talking about browser security! On Tuesday I met with a number of faculty, students and post-docs to talk about their research. One thing I kept emphasizing was that too much security research is really research in *insecurity* --- finding all kinds of new attacks! We already know there are lots of problems and at this point, we need more emphasis on defense. Unfortunately defense is harder and less amenable to crisp results. But we talked about how bug-finding technology could be used to speed up the bug fix cycle, by applying the technology to improve debugging and to search for regressions that would be caused by a patch. I'm hopeful we'll see progress in those areas.<br/><p>I really enjoyed the trip, although I'm finding that every time away I miss my family a little bit more. The flights were good. Movie picoreviews:<br/><ul><br/><li>Yes Man: OK<br/><li>Quantum of Solace: pretty good<br/><li>Valkyrie: OK (I wanted to like it more for the history and the compelling situation, but there seemed to be some unexplained important jumps)<br/><li>Taken: mediocre<br/><li>Defiance: OK<br/><li>In Bruges: brilliant!<br/></ul><br/></div><br/><br/>

<div class='content'>I&#39;m surprised it took so long to get to /. - the tracking bug, 478976 has been around since February and talks about building on Chrome bits....I tweeted about that bug in early March.<br></div>

<div class='content'>Why do you think Taken is just mediocre? I found it quite good and breathtaking. The movie is realistic, I think.<br></div>

<div class='content'>&quot;Taken&quot; is basically a generic action movie with nothing to lift it above the pack.<br></div>

<div class='content'>If you think of special effects...ok than you&#39;re right. But I go and see a film to see a good story and just to have lots of effects. But thats a matter of opinion.<br></div>
